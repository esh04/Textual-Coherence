# Textual-Coherence

## Dataset

We used the Grammarly Corpus of Discourse Coherence to train our model. Instructions to use the same can be found [here](https://github.com/aylai/GCDC-corpus)

The data was annotated as 1/2/3 depending on the coherence of the text. (3 being most coherent)

## Model 1

We use a discriminative approach, where an LSTM is trained to classify data into 1/2/3.

## Model 2
