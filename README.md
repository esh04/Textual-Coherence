# Textual-Coherence

## Dataset

The datasets used are:
1. The Grammarly Corpus of Discourse Coherence to train our model. Instructions to use the same can be found [here](https://github.com/aylai/GCDC-corpus)

2. https://github.com/AiliAili/Coherence_Modelling

## Model 1

We use a discriminative approach, where an LSTM is trained to classify data into 1/2/3.

## Model 2
