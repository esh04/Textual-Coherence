"text237NE","Why is it that no one really cares?","Why do people not really care if you were in the plane that crashed into the South Tower(Boeing 7 47)?","There are millions of us that do care, that even though we didn't lose someone personally, the events of 9-11 touched & affected ppl all over the world. The events of that day and those who were lost haven't been forgotten, nor should they ever be. It is our responsibility and duty to strive to bring something good out of all the horrible events of that day. (& it began the moment the first plane struck, there were many acts of bravery, heroism, self-sacrifice, and kindness). A beautiful monument will be built in honor and rememberance of those lost - however that is not the most important thing to do. The most important way to remember and honor those lost is to improve security, raise the standards of training for those in airports, in security, change and modify high rise rescue policies, new communications between fire and police departments,,,,,it is thru these that those loved ones that were lost will be truly honored.","2","3","1","2","3","3","3","3","3","3"
"text1820SC","Why do you Christians allow a spoiled brat god to throw people into the lake of fire if he doesn't ge his way?","I mean, I've put up with some bratty gods before, but not like yours.  He makes up the rules as he goes along, and has you hopping from one foot to the other just to keep up.  Does he like playing ""Simon Says"" and he's Simon?  I always thought ""Simon Says"" was a stupid game.  Very easy to cheat at.  Oh, that's what is isn't it?  He's cheating.","I think your misinformed. God gives you the ability to choose. If you choose to seperate your self from him and all the Good that he has created. Why do you blame him. It was your decision. Furthermore, he is so loving and gracious that he let a spoiled brat like me live most of my life as a rebel. When I fanally listened to what people had been telling me all those years, This merciful god was filled with joy and accepted me as a long lost son. I pray that you will at least keep this in the back of your mind and someday, maybe you'll be ready to listen. He'll be ready to  lovingly accept you.","2","1","3","2","1","3","2","1","2","1"
"text1649SC","how messed up is this?","im biracial (black and white) my grandma on my moms side is racist aganst black ppl!","I was raised with 2 biracial siblings. Mom is non hispanic white and married a non hispanic black man, creating my siblings.  I am the 41 year old mother of 4 biracial children.  My grandmother disowned my mother when she married my stepfather, and then me when i married my husband who is black.  Grandmother, after many many years met my eldest daughter and then my other 3 children and adores them all.  I believe that when people are raised to ""see"" people in only one way, it is very difficult to change the negative images and voices that echo in their heads.  I believe that we should not harbor ill feelings for people that are less exposed to the beauty of the world and have learned to except others for who, not what.  Saddness for someone that chooses to negate the existance of another, specifically someone of their own blood and family is a lonely place to be.  Forgive, be patient and consider that you must be the change...

"text245FR","Does anyone trust a friend more than talking to their family?","I trust my friends more than my family, is this the same for everyone? and is it right to trust people who you dont see that much with personal info?","Trust is a word that has been one of the words taken likely over the years as much as love has been.  Trust requires an undeniable affection of some sort that is unspoken and earned. When a person becomes married most of the time that person becomes there partner. In life it's not so easy. Once again it will come down to how much of yourself are you willing to expose to someone else. And if you have the confidence in that person to carry a piece of you around without causing you any hurt because now you are exposed.","1","1","3","1","1","3","3","1","2","2"
"text475T","The best destination for a holiday this summer?","Where are you going or already been and why?","Depends on what you're looking for in a holiday and your budget.  I have nothing planned for this year.  If you're in Europe, the Greek Islands are good, I've been to Kos and Rhodes, they're ideal if you're looking for a beach holiday.  The people are friendly, it's cheap, the food is good and you can do an excursion to Turkey where you can buy good quality leather goods.  Actually out of those two islands I would recommend Rhodes, there's also lot's to see and do there.

The Caribbean is a good choice but a little pricey.  I can recommend Dominica, The Nature Island of the Caribbean.   If you are willing to wait a while, Thailand, (particularly the islands,) are good value from October to April.","3","1","2","2","1","2","2","3","2","2"

However, they should't be over here illegally and were footing the bill. How can our government come to a resolution on this? Holla back.....","First and foremost we should take care of our own before we start taking care of another country's problems,and second we should take in immigrants that want to be US citizens and make this country their own,mexicans that are here illegaly want the US to change to their ways instead of the other way around,no other ethnic group that has come to this country has demanded what mexicans are now demanding,to disrespect our flag by flying theirs in our country while being here illegaly is a slap on the face of every US soldier that fought for our flag,the very country where these people come from do not permit another flag to be flown in that way and neither should it happen here,this just proves their loyalty will never be toward the US,even if they become US citizens.","2","2","2","2","1","2","3","3","2","2"
"text1500NE","Has anyone seen The Steve Colbert roast on Bush.?","The media focused on the Double Bush"" thing more than Mr.Colbert's speech and I wondering why(Im pretty sure they were around the same time). I guess people want to see comedy more than the sad truth, thats why you dont hear much about global warming I suppose. What were thought on his speech though. I thought it was funny until I realized most of it was true.","The media ignores people like Colbert because he is the one encouraging them to ask more difficult questions.  For almost the entire Bush administration, many reporters have ignored the hardest-hitting issues.  By ignoring Colbert, they probably hope that the American public won't reflect too heavily on Colbert's ideas, and will continue watching the news, where they can see MURDER MURDER MURDER OH HERE'S A CUTE PUPPY MURDER MURDER WEATHER SPORTS MURDER.

This is a Presidency that is trying to sweep all of its problems under the rug, so they might be left on the doorstep of the next poor sap who becomes President.  Women should be particularly outraged at this-- the most likely 2008 Democratic cantidate is Hillary Clinton.  The Democrats are poised to win the next election barring a catastrophe, which should sweep the first female President into office.  By leaving all these messes to clean up (rampant big corporations, Iraq, education, healthcare, etc), the Republicans are essentially dealing a great blow to female Presidential cantidates in the future.","2","2","2","2","2","3","1","2","2","2"
"text543NE","What happens to ticket holders if Delta pilots strike?","We have tickets to fly in June. I talked to customer service and they said they would get us on another airline for the same dates and if not, the money will be refunded. That's great on the refund if they don't file bankruptcy first.","Make sure you know your ticket number -- it's not the same as the confirmation number you got when you purchased the tickets.  If you have a ticket number you can usually get onto another flight with a different airline.  Also, having an actual paper ticket helps in thse sorts of situations.  Another thing you can do is to be prepared in case you are stuck in an airport.  Know which airlines go where you need to get to with flight numbers and times and stuff.  That way you'll be ahead of everyone else who is trying to get on a new plane too.","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3"

Besides, I don't do anything that I can't answer for, since we have been married.  My husband is very good to me, I don't want to do anything that will hurt him, not purposely anyway.

Have your parents take you to at least one show, I'd recommend Mystere, or Blue Man Group, my kids loved them. There are many others like, Mac King (this one is excellent and reasonably priced), Lance Burton, etc. There is so much to do in Vegas even if you are under 21.

"text1853T","Why Does NYC Have Poor Customer Service?","and why aren't the employees fired for being rude to customers?","I used to live near NYC.  I will say this.  New York is a great place, but one bad thing is poor customer service.  New York is a very fast-paced customer service environment.  Due to the fact that it is so fast-paced, the employees wind up being rude to their customers.  New York City is also very expensive.  A lot of the time employees are not fired is because many bosses feel that ""that is the way it is in New York.  Accept it or leave"".  Many people feel that this fast-paced environment gives New York City some sort of flavor.  It is what makes New York City, New York City.  It is part of the culture.

Many customer service representatives are also part of a union; therefore, it is more difficult to fire someone for almost anything.","2","2","2","2","2","3","1","2","2","2"

That aside, why not, personally speaking, I'm sick to death with todays politicians, they don't care, they are lining their own pockets with our dough for not very much in return, they do a lot against us, not for us. We need some fresh air in British politics, we need someone genuinely concerned about Britains future and how it is run, I don't think I will be sticking around for much longer unless it radically improves, I resent paying into a system that does very little for me, but does plenty for immigrants and scroungers who do not deserve it.","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","2","1","1"
"text1910SC","Christians, if the scripture is all true, then how is it possible people see ghosts, it doesnt make sense?","Because according to scripture that wouldnt be possible, but so many people claim to have seen them?","1) It could be demons, because scripture is obvious that they do interfere in human events. One might ask why demons would go around making strange noises, etc.... Well, my mom personally watches ghost channels on tv and I've seen how its turned her against Christianity, so if the demons want to turn people away from God, apparently they do a good job acting as ghosts. Naturally when you think of demon you might think of some horned beast that wants to go around killing people, but that is not their mission; their mission is deception, and ghosts apparently do deceive people away from God.

But this other guy is in one of my classes and i don't know his name. We're sort of friends, but we hardly talk to one another.

So we said no and my friend thought it was embarrassing to tell and I just said i don't care if he knows now and my friend told him that i like him and he told my friend that he liked me. Okay now my answer, maybe it's best if he didn't have a gf and bring it up with maybe a game of truth or dare with your asking you and respond a bit casual.

"text100PG","When will they actually be legal...?","Hey Everyone...I was wondering when sugar gliders, gerbils and ferrets will be legal in CA? I know people are trying to pass a bill for ferrets. Any ideas when they will be passed?","Sugar Gliders eat a large diet of fruits, and vegetables, along with insects that can help trees.  They also like to tear up bark.  CA has a large amount of produce, and as they are prolific breeders the chances that a pair reproducing could destroy trees and do serious damage to the cash crops is why they are illegal.  Also, wild gliders can carry diseases (if unhealthy) that are dangerous to the native animals, and have no natural predators in California.  As for when they will be legal, that's a hard thing to know.  I would imagine that they aren't going to be legal in that state for quite some time, especially with the amount of work and lobbying it takes to pass a law or overturn one.","2","2","3","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

I just hate it here so much but don't know where to go.  Just tell me what you like about where you live!","I bailed out on California about 2 years ago.  The state is beautiful, but I had just had it with the population, the real estate prices, and the urban sprawl.  I moved to southeast Alaska.  I will only recommend it if you can handle living independently, enjoy wilderness, and can handle extremes in weather.  If you can manage or even like those things Alaska is wonderful.  Your area of occupational interest will probably limit you to living in our big town, Juneau.  Rest easy though, Juneau only has around 30,000 residents.

I know this because when I talk to one guy my heart feels light and I can't help but smile when I talk to him, even if he's pissed or annoyed with me. And this is also the case with two other guys in my life. So can people really be in love with only one person? And is it okay to really love more than one person? Have any of you ever loved more than one person, so I know I'm not alone out there?","There is a difference between loving someone and being in love--it's a hard decision.  Yes, it is possible to  love more than one person at a time--it happens everyday.   Sometimes it is the attention or show of affection that you are in love with and not the actual guy.  haven't you ever thought if I could take this from that guy and that from this guy I would have the perfect guy!!!  Noone likes to be alone, so we look for little things that we can latch on to so that we don't go crazy.  There are no perfect people, so we have to find the one that is closest to what we need and then decide if that is enough or we keep looking.

I knew guys like that and sometimes it is hard to be so harsh to a nice person that you just have no interest in. It will be hard but if he keeps this up, there are authorities that can be noted. Maybe look into your local stalking laws. And if it gets really serious keep a documentation of times/dates that he bothers you. Overall, a new cell # isn't the worst idea.

We hear all the time the argument that these people are taking the jobs nobody wants, well that is a lie.  Look at the construction industry, the illegals have taken jobs away from legal Americans in this industry.  There are people in the United States who can not afford health insurance and yet the illegal immigrants get free health care from our government.  When our local law inforcement agencies find people who are undocumented and can't identify them, they call the Feds and guess what they are told...... ""Let them go, we don't have a place to put them"" or ""not enough man power.""     Our public schools in my area have all these special programs for these illegal immigrants, but what about my child? There is nothing so I have to hire a tutor for my child. There are some neiborhoods in CA and FL that are comprised of nothing but gangs which are made up of illegals and the local law enforcement groups are outmanned.  We are catering to a bunch of law breakers no matter how you look at it.  And our Federal Government is doing too little. We are continually talking about Homeland Security..... well they are not taking care of the biggest open area that smugglers, illegals (no matter what nationality), and terrorists can easily use to enter into our country, our Southern border.

In your spare time go to museums, art exhibits, theatre, and seminars. Culture yourself. Find things that interest you so that when you do meet someone you can carry a conversation intelligently.  Men, (especially white collar) love intelligent women.  They can also spot posers in an instant. So always be honest and never be embarrassed by your line of employment.

It's not a war and the casualty reports are joke.  In a real full scale war, 5000 deaths would be paltry.  The soldiers that are there are often glad to be there.  It's hard for them, but they can come home knowing they did good.","1","2","2","1","1","3","3","2","3","3"

The ring sat a long time at the bottom of the Anduin River after Isildur was killed and Deagol found it, the implication was several hundred years.  Smeagol killed deagol for the ring and upon discovering he was invisible when wearing it, he used it for evil, sneaking and stealing.  He was eventually driven off by his family and the community.  Over the years he became over sensitive to the sun and began to hide underground during the day, this lead him under the mountains.

We can live life and die without no punishment for what we can do. So, there's no guilt in what we can do right?","Whats your basis for saying God doesn't exist? Because you can't see Him? Well I can't see you, only your words and since I can't see you does it mean that you doesn't exist? No. Same with God.  We don't see Him but we have his words which are supposed to be a testament to how we are to live.

You only have no guilt when you have no conscience, and no conscience when you are a cold, heartless, selfish, immoral person. I don't think that's the kind of influence you want to have in society is it?

I wonder if it may mean that when God's will is done on earth, it is because faithful believers are committed to doing it.

So, how do we determine God's will? What is His will which is being done in His heavenly Kingdom, which we should use as a pattern here on earth?","If there is such thing as ""GOD's Will"" then there is NO such things as Free Will. Then why complain when you fail in life or evil acts takes place around you or when someone kills your dear one or something like Sept 11 takes place in USA. Accept it has GOD's Will!

Instead i strongly believe in KARMA & Free Will. In fact KARMA is generated from one's Free Will; it is our daily actions & habits that creates KARMA.

"text1192T","I live in zimbabwe,why  the negative attitude?","it's got everything for visitors, doesn't have the crime of kenya or RSA, despite it's problems it's still probably the safest country on the continent,","I think it is mostly because of the World's attitude towards the obvious cases of racism that occured over the past few years- involving the farms and everything. It may take time for people to get over the fact that their land was taken from them and they were left almost penniless with nowhere to go. I personally think that racism is as much of a crime as anything else. It is mostly our perception of crime and security that influences decisions- The crime situation in Kenya is not directed towards a single race- pretty much every body is affected by it, people of all races and all ages. What happened in Zimbabwe was directed at a particular race, and there is no justification for that regardless of what anyone says, I am not taking sides, but maybe there was a more just way of dealing with any problems that the locals had. The negative attitude comes mainly from tourists and the media all over the world. Tourists come to africa mainly for the wildlife and safaris etc.. Therefore the tourists have to be from a place where these things do not exist. ie: Europe, Asia, North America - ""Most"" Europeans are white, they are the closest continent to africa and obviously most of the tourists come from there. After the whole racism fiasco, it is clear to see why the ""World"" would have a negative attitude toward Zimbabwe.","2","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

It depends how long you've been around him as well if you two have been together only recently then perhaps he's trying to see just how far he will get. Then again if you guys know each other for a while and have been hanging out together for some time it could be that he is slowly working his way towards a deeper connection with you.

Remember, you CANNOT change him, he is who he is and if you fell in love with him while he was wearing sweats then that is what you got, a man who likes sweats.  However, if he didn't start wearing them until after you were engaged, try asking him why he doesn't clean up anymore.  If he says ""I don't know"" then ease into the subject by telling him how much you liked it when he dressed nicer. Make sure you tell him you like it, don't throw it up to him that you always dress for him, you have to make it his idea. You also need to make sure his clothes look nice before he puts them on, don't want to sound old fashioned here but it is your responsibility to make sure his clothes are clean and pressed before he puts them on.  Good luck.","3","2","2","3","2","3","1","2","3","2"
"text333AH","on being single - i'd like to hear from romantic people?","i've finally come around. i don't think i'm meant to be happy in love (just my fate) & will most likely remain single. so what I do is, I engage in whatever gives me that romantic allure; going for a walk, reading a love novel, seeing a movie, learning a new language, attempting to paint/draw/write...I do miss passion but I try to help myself in any way I can, :) 

how do you find this...I believe in destiny & there is only so much you can do... 

thanx...

ps) Pl. don't write about what has nothing to do with romance & passion (work, career, hobbies, friends - that's a different world). I'd like to hear from someone who understands, that's why I said...","I understand how you feel.  Too many times have I told myself that I wasn't meant to be in love.  It's been hard for me because I've always kinda felt like one of those hopless romantics, but lately it's been more like hopeless.  I do spend a lot of time writing poems and I'm even working on a novel....but also a lot of the time I'll avoid the romantic things just because they make me sad and miss the feeling of being in love.

But I've come to the realization that if I allow myself to believe there is noone for me, than I might not notice her when she comes knocking at my door.  I think it's important not to give up and not accept a fate that I truly don't know is mine.","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","3","1","2"

I was thinking that Balance of Power explains it, but I do not really know how, and I needed some help. I also need to talk about how The Iraq War is looking more and more like Vietnam and why. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!","Balance of Power is a good start.  Remember that the French, although they had granted Vietnam independence, were still funneling support to the VC.  So were the Chinese.  Meanwhile, American leadership at the time the fighting started were heavily invested in munnitions companies, much like the leadership today is invested in oil companies.  At the time of the Vietnam Conflict, the invasion of Western Europe by the Soviet Union was a viable possibilty.  The Soviets watched Vietnam very closely, and were convinced by the conflict that the West could indeed survive a prolonged ground assault in Europe, thus removing this from their agenda.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in the Middle East, where potential enemies continue to expand their military capabilities.","1","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"
"text863PG","would you trade your rights for safety?","would you trade your freedom for security? when i say security, i just mean protection from foreign attackers.","Some level of protection is a very basic and pretty much universally accepted function of government.  But of course with this protection, comes a certain level of freedom loss.  I think our consitutiion in the US helps us maintain a pretty good balance of personal rights considerations versus the governments ability to stop individuals from harming others.  There has got to be a balance somewhere, and that is why we have things like ""probable cause"" and ""reasonable suspicion.""  So, I would have to say that I am willing to give up some freedom for the sake of protection and safety.

Sometimes just being a good listener is more help than you think.  She is probably afraid to tell her parents.  You might offer to let her ""practice"" by telling you, just like she is going to have to tell her parents.  That might make it so it's not as hard telling them.  Did she take a test or see a doctor?  She really needs to tell her parents as soon as she is sure that she is pregnent so they can help her get the medical attention that she will need.

Presuming that you are comfortable with drawing and some other medium such as watercolor or pastel or acrylic, and just want to master the technique of oil, this is not difficult. Just use good materials from the beginning, and for your health, make sure that you use genuine turpentine (ask your chemist or doctor) and refined linseed oil. For continuing work you should use a mixture of the oil and the turpentine, 1:3 parts. In pigments I recommend 10 colors: black, white, 3 earth colours, green plus blue, 2 reds and yellow. For more advanced techniques, such as glazing and impasto, join a class. Only ever choose a teacher whose work you admire.

I listen, almost exclusively to NPR and find myself agreeing with Republicans from time to time (horrors) and getting mad at Democrats (not too surprising, actually).  I know that I have heard several stories on NPR about the fact that no WMDs were found and my understanding is that a lot of networks (even those we are told skew left) simply dropped it as a story and don't address it, or merely mention it and don't do in depth reporting on it.

I sincerely doubt that Fox is going around saying that WMDs have been found, but that their early reporting and then non-reporting affected the opinion of their viewership.

God has blessed North America with more than enough resources to help those in need, yet the need is still there. Why?

You are looking for reasons not to. There are many reasons to believe if you take the time to check them out. Even Einstein acknowledged his creator! There really are intelligent reasons to believe in a creator.The reason I believe is because He is. A house must have a builder, a cake must have a baker, all things that show sign of intelligent design must have a creator. The Bible says, the heavens are declaring the glory of God and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. One might look into the book of  Isaiah 40:22  where it says, ""He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and it's people are like grasshoppers."" Here we have the word of the ancient prophet Isaiah writing words inspired by the Almighty Jehovah. It tells us the earth is a circle way before science ever knew! The Bible is filled with all kinds of things that ancient people would never have known had it not been for the Lord giving us this information. Before you draw your conclusions, take another look at the evidence and read the Bible from cover to cover. When you examine the scientific evidence(yes, science does back up the Bible) you will find that the story of evolution is a weak one.From the evidence of how the earth was formed and how we were created from the dust, you will find that indeed we do have a maker. We must all stand before the throne and give an account to Him one day.Better make sure you are right before you dismiss His existance.","2","1","1","1","1","3","3","2","1","2"

Instead of jumping her for the way she's acting, try approaching her in a different way.

Approach her with concern and care... Tell her you've been upset about the way she's acting and you want to know if she is doing okay.  Ask her how she's feeling, how her life is going, and if there is anything you can do to help.  Try not to turn it into an accusation or yelling match about her behaviors with drinking/drugs/responsibility.

Clear your mind and ask God what is going on, He will reveal His path for you.  When I was saved I did feel different, I knew it was real, but the peace and presence of God that He has shared with me came much later after I grew in faith and wanted a real relationship with God not just seeking a feeling.

Had something happened in the US, there would have been little attention given on what had happened.  Statistically, Aruba is a very safe place, especially compared to how other countries are.  Visitors need to be held accountable for their actions and realize that you can't do whatever you want when you visit places.  You need to take the same precautions when you travel (meaning no going off with strangers in strange places).  I like Aruba and would never let one rare incident change my decision to visit.  I also think it's wrong that anyone try to influence others too avoid a place over press that they hear on the news.  Media in general tends to be biased in making people believe their side of the story.  Good journalism would accentuate how nice the island is and state how rare kidnappings and violence is, rather than hiding the obvious that the young woman probably had way too much to drink and her friends let her go off on her own.","3","1","2","2","2","3","2","2","2","2"

There is no single answer to that question on which all scientists agree.  When we were dealing solely in macroversal terms, that is events we can see and measure with standard instruments like a yardstick, four dimensions were sufficient, length, width, breadth, and duration.  Time is not a dimension, that's a misconception, time is the tool we use to measure duration, just as we use inches or meters to measure length.  When particle physics and quantum mechanics, not to mention Special and General Relativity, became accepted, it was discovered those were inadequate to explain the Universe as we were beginning to understand it.  One theory is that there are the four we started with, plus 6 dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds located at every point in 3 dimensional space.  Another is that the universe we can physically interact with is only a 3 dimensional brane suspended in a 4 dimensional bulk.   So we have either 7 or 10, depending on which authority you ask.  A third theory is that there are two four dimensional branes separated by a 2 dimensional space, but at least that still only leaves us with 10.  I personally like theory number three, because for all practical purposes we're back in I like to think of as the real world, and only physics guys have it with which to deal.","1","2","2","1","1","2","2","1","3","1"

On the same hand, though, I feel he has disrespected me in a way.  Sure, it's not technically cheating, but I have a problem with him seeing naked women dance in front of him.  

The worst part is he ""asked"" me f it was alrght before he went yesterday morning.  I said, ""do whatever you want to, I can't tell you what to do"".  That's totally true, but I didn't think he would really do it.  Just because he does whatever he wants dosen't mean it wont hurt me.

I just can't imagine the man I love more than anyone in the world with fake tits wiggeling in his face.  He is so much better than that.

We have been together over a year and this is the first time.  I love him with all my heart and soul and, for me, he is the only man in the world.  I only have eyes for him.  <br/>I really don't want it to happen again.  Should I say anything","You should definetely say something so that it does not happen again.  If your boyfriend loves you as much as you love him, then he will understand.  You said that he feels guilty so I am 100% sure that he will understand you as long as you explain to him why you don't like him going to a strip club.  Honesty is the key to everything in a relationship.

I totally understand where you are coming from too.  I wouldn't like it either if my boyfriend would go to a strip club.

What are your predictions or ideas to end the war?","To end the war? I'm intrigued as to whether you were for the war when it started? The war was always based on lies, and those who did not understand that in the first place, I am sure will have no idea on how or even why to end the war, because their thoughts are not their own and are based on what they are told by the media and other media drinking sponge-heads, I find it quite maddeningly incomprehensible that the majority of the people in a country as big as the USA can at one point be openly and confidently all for a war (that kills thousands of people and wrecks millions of lives) and then a little while later change their minds and say 'oh no this isn't right, lets stop this now'. (from the comfort of their TV armchair)  I sometimes think the only reason Americans want to stop the war is not because they think its unjust, but because they do not like the bad image the rest of the world seem to be portraying them as.

So back to your question; I think the way to end this war is to bite the lip and say frickin sorry, open up talks with the Resistance and find out what there problem is, find out why there is so much hatred to the west (pre 9,11) and lets all try to make this home a one where we respect each other, and if that means making some (maybe colossal) changes, then so be it. What we need now is some honest and humble conversation, and to stop listening to nonsense that is only told so greedy fat heads can make more money.","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","3"

I had left him for a few days and he begged me to come home and i did. He told me he didn't cheat but in my heart i know he did. He stopped seeing her but i'm still concerned with their relationship. It's only been three weeks since that and now things are no better. He want us to split up, but I don't. I'm so confused with this decision. Why did he ask me to return if he didn't really want me ther? I divorce enevetable?","Divorce is not inevitable if you don't want it to be.  I would sit your husband down and have a talk with him.  Tell him that you will NOT put up with him spending his time with a female.  That is what you are there for.  If he isn't getting something from you, then he needs to tell you what is lacking from you and vise versa.  If he wants to split up then, go with your gut.  He is probably having an affair with her.  Maybe not a physical one, but one just the same.  I have a feeling that something like that is going on with my husband, but I can't prove it and when I tell him how I feel, things seem to change.  For a while.  To tell you the truth and I'm talking from experience, I don't know which is worse.  A relationship where they meet and do what they are going to do or have a relationship that is emotional.

One thing that I would be asking myself in your place, is why would he want me to come home?  Did he do it because he couldn't handle me leaving him and he wants to be the one leaving?  Or did/does he still love me and is miserable in the marriage?  I don't think anyone can tell you what YOU should do.  That has to be up to you.  Different people will react and respond differently.

The story of Atlantis, its rise and fall, is related in two of Plato's dialogs, Timeaus and Critias.  The accounts given were supposedly brought back from Egypt by the famous Athenian lawgiver and traveler Solon and related in the course of conversations (dialogs) to Socrates (Plato's teacher) and hence to Plato.

But there aren't 3 days between Friday and Sunday.  How are we counting those days.  Don't get me wrong, I believe in God, and that he sacrificed his only begotten son.

The ""first day of the week"" started after the close of the Sabbath, Saturday sunset. Since there were no witnesses recorded in Scripture, He could have risen after the Sabbath rest and before midnight, the start of Sunday - which would make sense because God abhors all pagan traditions of man (specifically, Sunday, the ""venerable day of the sun god"" according to Emperor Constantine & the Popes). God has NEVER tolerated paganism mixed in with His worship. There is no prophesy in Scripture to lead the faithful to believe that Jesus rose on Sunday. ""Easter"" is the pagan vernal equinox celebration of the fertility goddess Ashtar/Ishtar. ~Easter Sunday~ is a double heretical abomination to God.","2","2","1","1","1","2","3","3","3","3"

In my own real life I was told in 2000 at a Bible study that I had to pick between Jesus and Evolution.

I believe man evolved through natural selection from an ape. I do. I won't lie to you about it and I can't explain it as well as a text book could.

It does not have to be from Satan.  There are three enemies every Christian faces:  1) Satan, 2) The world, and 3) themselves.  All three of these things will try and tear you away from God.  I don't know who told you that you had to choose between Jesus and evolution, they were wrong.  As long as you believe Jesus is the Messiah and you accepted him as you Lord and Savior you are good to go.  All your other beliefs don't mean anything.  To trust God completely you do have to agree with everything in the Bible.  But I don't think anyone trusts God completely.

The strips were then layered, pounded together and smoothed to make a flat, uniform sheet.

Ancient paper pieces from the Xuanquanzhi ruins of Dunhuang in China's northwest Gansu province apparently were made during the period of Emperor Wu who reigned between 140 BC and 86 BC. Whether or not Ts'ai Lun was the actual inventor of paper, he deserves the place of honor he has been given in Chinese history for his role in developing a material that revolutionized his country.","2","3","3","3","2","2","1","2","3","2"

How many heads of state in history have ever done that?   Bhutan is the only country in the world to have completely banned the sale of tobacco.   He has introduced a national happiness index, instead of GDP, as a measure of well-being, for making policy decisions.   Google national happiness index to learn more.   To cut a long story short, more consumption and  more choice haven't resulted in more happiness; some respectable studies by western psychologists have indicated this.

Many atheists claim that those who have never heard of Jesus Christ should not be forced to go to hell.","God is fair and just, as hell is a punishment for sin. But God is so loving that he provided a way out of hell, which is the punishment all mankind deserve, by sending Jesus to pay for our sins and be punished in our place.

So much of the truth is left out of the information which is broad casted to the public, and therefore the public is never really 'in the know' about the real happenings of the world. Seek truth, go outside the United States press and read what other countries are focusing on, and see what they are saying about happenings within the United States. Never take the media as being anything more than a biased opinion and a partial truth.

But i wanted to know what you guys (the public.) felt. Because i do have a friend who i admit is a bit off sometimes..lol But they have said that they wonder if Jesus's power, such as walking on water and turning water into wine. Exist, and if i was just a myth and we could all be worshiping a false god. I didn't agree with my friend, but friend has also said that if aliens are real, that Jesus's mother Mary, could have been abducted by an alien, then produced Jesus, and we (humans) could all be the product of an alien species. I defenatly don't agree, but maybe if you, or all of you could share your insight on what my friend is saying. Maybe that would streghten him out, my friend of course.","Although many people might find this question offensive, I think that in this day and age, especially with the Da Vinci Code movie that just came out to accompany the best-selling book, questions like these are going to become more commonplace. However, as a Christian, I do have a Biblical response to the idea of us worshipping a false god. In the Book of Genesis, the entire first chapter lists all of the things God created and aliens are definitely not a part of the list.  Additionally, in the New Testament in the Book of John, the first two verses of the first chapter explain that before God created anything, there was just God, Jesus, and God's Word (that would later be written through man, but would still be the words of God). So the idea of aliens abducting Mary and impregnating her with Jesus is impossible because 1) aliens were never created, and 2) Jesus was alive before ANYTHING was created. The only way Jesus could have been born as a human on earth was through Divine intervention because only God has the power to execute such supernatural acts as having a virgin give birth to the Messiah.

They encourage you to sneak into Mexico since you send back $20 billion a year. It is win-win for him and his pals. He pays nothing to help you and you help out his economy.

Plus he has used NAFTA to his advantage to help create jobs in Mexico in addition to creating a large number of jobs through joint government/private industry initiatives.  And all this investment in industry and education is possible because the government doesn't have to support all of those families that are being lost in the transition from an agricultural to an industrial society.

So instead of creating a nation of people dependant on welfare programs he's allowing them to come to the US and work for their money.

Not to mention, keeping everyone looking the same is impossible.  But, assuming even if that could be done, then people could still be different.  Even taste, though that is a weird way to classify people.  Also our personality, affecting hearing as well, along with sight, depending on posture and stance along with what we say through our mouths will affect how others view us.  Maybe initially, it might work.  Wars would eventually break out.  People would have a hard time finding love, since everyone would be male/female, depending how we all looked, so we would also all die afterwards, since we could not procreate.

I asked him how could he do this in front of me when he knew I loved him so much for all those years we were married.","To recover from infidelity trauma, a victim has a natural tendency to go back to the traumatic experience, questioning, going over details repetitiously:  “What did you do?  Where? When? How often?”  The traumatized spouse must go over the events until the emotional distress caused by them becomes manageable.  They must reach a point where they feel there are no more surprises.

Often, the betraying spouse wants to get things over quickly, after admitting to their infidelity.  They must develop empathy for what the betrayed spouse is experiencing, and be willing to live with the pain of guilt, until genuine healing can occur.  In addition, the betraying spouse may learn something about them self in the questioning process.  They may begin to see their own motives, vulnerabilities, and selfishness.  If both spouses can tolerate and control the emotions involved, they may come to a joint understanding of how the infidelity occurred, signaling the beginning of a more substantial level of recovery. Recovery usually takes 1 to 3 years. But it look to me that he is just hanging around waiting for more favorable circumstances.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","3"

The fact that Iraq now has a Representative government, elected by a free people, serves as a model for oppressed people throughout the world.

It could be a simple cross-cultural misunderstanding.  A North American  hostess resposibilities lie in making sure the party is taken care of via the supplies (cake, enough refresshments and food, perhaps enough chairs, music, etc.) .  N. Americans do not usually facilitate conversations other than introductions.  On the other hand, some cultures need a go-between to be constantly there (e.g. Japanese) as a buffer between the two groups for communication to take place.  Lubricating the conversation, if you will.  I suspect differences in cultural practices made both parties feel uncomfortable and without you paying CONSTANT attention to bringing the two groups together, they retreated to the safety of mingling within their own group, even sitting in different rooms.

There's no other way to do it, it's not a point and shoot project. :) Check on your batteries too.

NOTE: If you are trying to capture something that takes a long time to occur and in which not much happens quickly you will want to set the interval at around a minute and the record time as short as possible on your camera. An example would be if you wanted to record a day in the life of a flower or the clouds rolling by in the sky. Suppose however that you want to capture an event that has lots of action and occurs over a much shorter time frame. Then you would want to shorten the interval between recordings and increase the time of each recording. So in this case you might record every 15-30 seconds and record up to 2-3 seconds of video each time.","2","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","1","2"
"text1442AH","where did the maderia  sail in 1418?","what land mark was it locatede at","Portugese sailors, led by Prince Henry the Navigator, re-discovered the island of Madeira (first discovered by the Romans) and settled there in 1418.  Madeira is located in the North Atlantic, about 500 kilometers off the coast of Portugal and north of Africa.  The Madeira region contains several islands, of which Madeira and Porto Santo are the only two that are inhabited today.   If there is a specific ship called the Madeira that you are refering to, it may have been the one that sailed to the Madeira Islands, and therefore may have been the islands' namesake.  However, I have never seen a reference to any such ship... If anyone else has, please elaborate...","1","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","2","3"
"text1167PG","Can you define Bush's Plan For Iraq like a DEMOCRAT can?","Senator Kerry in the last Presidential campaign popularized the theory that President Bush doesn't have a plan to win the war in Iraq and ever since then the Democrats have been grabbing ahold of this idea like a life-preserver in a raging sea of stupidity. Follow the illogic ....

Since they lost the election to Bush again, Democrat leaders have had to come up with their own plan in Iraq to replace the plan that Bush had that isn't working. Huh? That's right, first Bush didn't have a plan and then he had a plan but his plan isn't working so they had to come up with their own plan to replace the nonexistent plan that doesn't work. Wow! And Democrats say their party hasn't been taken over by liberal extremists.

To top it all off, when asked specifically what the Democrat plan is last week, Harry Reid and Howard Dean said that they didn't have to come up with a plan because ""we're not in charge"". Nancy Pelosi even said, when referring to House Democrats, ""we don't have a plan for Iraq"".","Bush had a plan. As unrealistic and photo-op'd as it was. According to BushCo, we were going to be treated as liberators and people were going to throw flowers and praise the Almighty Bushs Name. We'd be out of Iraq in a year. And it's been how long now? The only ones that threw the flowers and cheered us on when we pulled down the statue of Saddam were bussed in from Jordan.

Do democrats have a plan? Probably not. Bush has been totally screwed this up and now we're going to be there for some time to come. The initial plan was flawed and ill-conceived. And the Powers that came up with it wouldn't hear any criticism of it. And because of their inability to face reality, they've blamed everyone but themselves.","2","3","2","3","2","1","3","2","2","2"

"text148AH","How can I find my actual purpose in Life? Thanks :)?","I have read and heard often that in order to lead a life of meaning, we have to follow our life purpose with passion. Well I have been trying to understand my purpose but I am getting muddle headed. I love doing the following - Creative work - web design, graphic design, canvas painting, photography, travelling, wildlife, exploring, talking to new people, exploring new cultures, enjoying freedom, serving/helping others, innovating/inventing, experimenting. Also I get bored doing one thing or being in one profession for a long time as I always need a change or a challenge. So it is difficult for me to articulate what could be my ultimate purpose as I feel like doing a lot of things all at once. Hence I am not able to decide where I can focus my mental and physical energy.

Could any body guide me on the above dilemma.<br/>Thanks in advance :)","You seem to know what you love doing, and there are a few choices, so why haven't you picked one? Why hasn't one held your interest enough for you to make it your life's passion? You've made a list of creative and fun things, then you stuck in serving/helping others. I'm sure you like helping others, but it sounds a bit like you felt the need to stick in something that isn't frivolous. Sometimes we think in order to fulfill our life properly we have to sacrifice and God forbid we have fun. There are lots of ways to fulfill our lives and we all can't be the one who finds the cure for cancer. People find enjoyment in music, rock stars fill a void that is necessary even though we wouldn't consider them pious by any stretch of the imagination, but music does indeed soothe the soul, life would be empty without it. A waitress takes care of a lot of people in one afternoon, it's not most people's idea of a dream job, but with a genuine smile, maybe a friendly word she's brightened someone's day. Her purpose in life? Probably.

Painting, photographing, all these things move humanity in many different ways. Any of those would be idealistic professions. Humanity needs to find comfort, that is what art is all about. It also serves to stir the imagination. So travel around potographing wildlife then painting them while you enjoy your freedom. Lol. Whatever you choose humanity is served. You'll know when you hit on it because you will keep coming back to it. Whatever it is you will have fulfilled your life purpose.","2","1","2","1","3","3","2","3","2","3"
"text886NE","Why do peace protestors protest in America?","There are so many people, from those religious groups that protest at funerals to those activists who publicly decry our being in the middle east, who protest in America. My question is, if they want peace so bad, why are they protesting in one of the few countries in the world that is not currently experiencing a war within their borders? Why wouldn't those people bring their message of peace to those countries who truly need it - like Sri Lanka, who have been experiencing a civil war for the past 30 years with a terrorist organization - the Tamil Tigers? Who didn't they bring their message of peace to Iraq, who's Kurdish people where slaughtered by the hundred of thousands by chemical weapons and military might over decades of Saddam Hussein's rule? <br/>Isn't protesting within our borders about peace similar to walking into a crowded Denny's and screaming about how there are starving people in Africa? While the statement is true - couldn't you get more done IN AFRICA?","The answer is that most protesters do not believe their message enough to bring to those areas that truly need it. They know that they have the freedom to protest in this country, because of the fact we have been willing to fight tyranny in the past. They also know that if they were to take their message of peace to those other countries who do not enjoy peace and freedom, they may very well be killed by the people they are trying to help. Too many people enjoy their freedom of speech, and take for granted the blood that was shed to achieve it.

Lets keep things in perspective. Yes were are now involved in a war in another country - however the combined losses over three years (combatant and non-combatant) do not equal the number of losses we experienced in one day from a terrorist attack within our borders - something that has not happened again ever since we took the fight into the enemy's territory.","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"
"text297SC","My priest said it was ok to kill as much as I wanted, as long as it was in a war, doesn't that sound evil?","I asked many years ago before joining the Army.  First I asked if it was always wrong to kill, and he said yes.  Then I told him I was joining the army and he said it didn't matter how many people you killed as long as it is in warfare.  I'm not sure jesus would have given the same answer.","I don't agree with that and I think that you're of the same mind. First of all yes there are times that are nessasary to take a life in war, but if you're killing innocent people and or children without provocation then I think that you'll probably be in trouble when you meet your maker. I think that the other thing that you have to take into consideration is your conscience. You and God know the situation. As long as you're defending your life and the life of others that's one thing. I do know that many men killed woman and children in the Vietnam war and it has left really bad scares on them along with deep mental problems. That was a tough war because I do think that there were many woman and children who set our service members up to be killed and the men in our forces didn't know who was good and who was bad. The most important thing to go by is your conscience. You know if you're killing for pleasure or survival except in extreme cases like in Vietnam. I'll never judge a man that fought in that War, for any of his actions, I know that God will show his full mercy on those men, especially all the ones that have carried the scares, horrors, and nightmarish images of that war all the rest of their lives. They gave up so much, and have never really recovered or had normal lives since. It is indeed a heavy burden to carry.

Now if a nation goes to war because it feels threatened, that is a decision the country makes if it feels that is what it must do for its own survival. However, the idea that God is on one side or the other is repugnant to me. Leave God out of it.","Absolutely - this is what religion has taught - not God.  He used war in the old Testament to fulfil his promise of the Abrahamic coveneant and fulfillment of the Law - but his grace in sending Jesus as the fullfillment of both took care of that and war is now very simply man not getting what he wants - when I first heard that definition I was a little confused because it was used as one at war with himself being anger - and I worked with troubled teen boys - and it dawned on me what it was these boys were at war with - they wanted parents, who loved them enough to set rules and boundaries and enforce them; they wanted parents who gave them positive role models and guides, not tv's, vcrs, and all the video games to occupy their times - but themselves and that was why they were at war with themself and angry - once I learned that I began to apply the definition to all wars and angers and it is a very logically sound definition - not getting what I want is war - either with myself or others - and it doesn't matter on what scale it is - and there is no holy war - holiness is to be in worship of an almighty God and to worship an almighty God does not allow for self-focused anger - so it is an oxymoron by all forms of imagination in my books.","2","2","2","2","1","1","3","3","3","2"

Inverness is lovely and I can highly recommend Castle View Guest House, rooms from £22 a night. Find it on the Internet.  From there you can visit Colloden (check it is open but I think it is and get a real feeling for the Highlands.  Use the Scottish Tourist Board book ahead scheme to find somewhere to stay.  Just set off and at the first tourist board office you come to ask them to book a bed for you that night in the place you want to stay in.

It's hard for me to fall in love and to trust these single men.  Sometimes I think that if I dated divorced men with a kid, they will be somewhat more responsible, mature, and I for myself don't want to have my kids.   What do you think and is it true that men will be more responsible, family oriented after a divorce?","No.You are not insane to think about dating men who are divorced with kids. Regardless if the man is divorced or never married there are lot of men who have kids from previous relationships so if you really love the men and want to be with them that means you accept the children as well. Just think about it. How would you feel if you was a divorced or single mother with kids and a man didnt want to date you becos you have kids. Maturity and being a real man will make him more responsible. It dont matter if he is divorced. The divorce from the start may have ended because he was not mature. You never know. But as far as trust is concerned it comes from both people. You have to first trust and believe in yourself before you can believe in others and all men are not the same. Men will treat you bad if you allow them to do it.","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","3","2","2"

Which brings me to his proposal to eliminate the estate tax...WHY?  Why eliminate a tax that only affects the wealthiest .8% of americans?  We need some tax revenue to run our country and to protect it.  If we reduce the taxes for the wealthiest americans, then either we have to raise taxes for the lower and middle class or cut some things from the budget, like the student loan program, which is one of the things Bush wants to cut, and other things those people who are struggling depend upon our government to provide.","2","3","3","3","1","3","2","2","2","2"

I was really interested in World War II, read the entire section on it in my history book as soon as we hit it, and I usually don't read my history book. Hitler's idea of the arian race was mostly as follows: blonde hair, blue eyes, tall, white, and for the most part German. Many of the people who didn't fit that description were shunned from his attention or thrown into concentration camps, where they were worked to death, or death camps in which they were just basically killed off and/or experimented on.

If you want a hassel free flight - give your son some Benadril for Children medicine just before you get on the plane (before security check point - where they may take the liquids away - if over 4 oz.) . It will knock him out and he will slepp the whole flight. Makes your flight stress free versus him crying due to air pressure - feeding him - entertaining him etc.  Remember that you can not carry lots of liquids on planes - even for children - so don't bring too much stuff as carryon or it will be taken from you.

Other indicators of contemporary influence are his inclusion in the top 10 of the ""100 Greatest Britons"" poll sponsored by the BBC, the frequent productions based on his work, such as the BBC Television Shakespeare, and the success of the fictional account of his life in the 1998 filmShakespeare in Love!!!","1","2","3","2","3","1","1","2","3","2"

It would be nice to see his have to suffer some special punishments such as the one you suggested but unfortunately, it often seems that the criminals in the United States have more rights than the victims, especially in California.

It’s generally thought that the poem was performed orally by the poet before a “live” audience, and that in this way it eventually passed down to readers and listeners. Another theory is that the poem was recited by memory by a “scop,” a traveling entertainer who went from court to court, singing songs and telling stories, until it was finally written down at the request of a king who wanted to hear it again.

Because there are three major battle scenes in the poem, some readers believe that Beowulf was composed by three different authors. Other readers claim that the sections that take place in Denmark and the sections that occur after Beowulf returns to Geatland were the work of different authors. The majority of critics agree that because of the unified structure of the poem, with its interweaving of historical information into the flow of the main narrative, the poem was most likely composed by one person.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","3","3","3"

I know this because that is what everyone in power is trying to do, to maintain their own power and then increase it in any way they can.  That's politics, the idea for the American public is to keep switching between the two so neither side gains too much power.  Its the Democrats turn now, we'll go back Republican later.

Go to Court for your County and they will tell you if you qualify for any programs they have. Good luck.","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

We are the most prominent nation on the American continents, I suppose, and our soldiers who go to Europe routinely to die in wars to protect them from themselves are called Americans by the people who are grateful to be liberated. Maybe that is where it came from. As in, the dudes who come from overseas to our blessed Europe.

You sound like you still love him, but in a friends only way. Make sure that you are firm in tell him this. If he can't accept it, then you need to tell him you guys can't be friends anymore and go thru with it. It's always hard to lose someone you love, and it takes time to get over that.

I keep wondering what she thinks of me; I know it shouldn't matter but still.....any ideas?","First of all never compare yourself with someone else. Look at what she is doing. She is probably a visual learner. You are a different kind of learner. You need to figure out how you learn. My daughter is a wonderful dancer, but she has to practice and learned to use her resources.  First ask the girl to show you the step while you are in the corner or at the bar (which talking in class though), stay after to work on combination.

Eurocard marked EC on the card is the very best credit card and will pay for things without a fee.  No credit card from the US is good as you will always get hit with a fee and you may get a bad exchange rate as well.

Cash is best.  Many smaller pensions, restaurants and such will not accept American credit cards.  Some will only accept EC debit cards.  Banks will change travellers checks for you - you can buy Euro-denominated travellers checks in the US.

Of course those symbols would be rejected by someone opposed to smoking and drinking.

Drug dealers are a bunch of lazy pieces of feces, and rely on the fact that most people are afraid to say anything.   STAND UP FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY!  He will go away if you all stick together and make doing his business difficult for him.  If he doesn't tell your son to stay away, follow through. Your son might get mad, but tough. Drugs are no joke. Also, try taking him to a neonatal intensive care unit to see all the crack babies and their terrible defects and misery.

the muslims think its unfair...that they are treated like this by a ""foreign occupier"" (not even concidering the semitic divide)...and that the USA does not reprimand the foreign occupier, but reprimands them when they react aggressively because someone killed their sibling, etc. 

Its the old unfairness joke...the one that causes hatred, and vengeance to spring up, and the main cause of all wars:

 Its like if a big brother punched you...and then you reacted back by punching him...your dad reprimands you for punching him but not your brother...

Is this justice? Is this injustice in the middle east going to come back to haunt us...the way injustice always does...

so is our unconditional support of Israel harming us","No.  Support for Israel is in the long term strategic interests of America.  Israel is not without flaws, but they are better than those around them.  Because Israel is outnumbered 60:1, they don't always have the luxury of acting by American standards.  Remember where 9/11 came from?  Remember what happened when Neville Chamberlain gave up Czechoslovakia to Hitler?

America's support is not unconditional.  When Israel was attacked by Egypt and Syria in 1973, the US held back support.  This had the effect of saving Egypt's army and led to a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.  America's continuing limited support precludes a military solution by either side and thus makes a just peace by diplomatic means possible.","3","3","3","3","1","3","3","2","2","2"

I would like you to tell America exactly what they did to their soldiers on Tuesday, and what WE think about our countrymen right now.

""I hope you are satisfied with what you have done...

Today in the mess hall, where there is usually jovial conversation, there was silence, long faces, and broken spirits... Everyone, to include all American soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen, Iraqi Nationals, Bulgarian Soldiers, etc, etc... was speechless, tired, demoralized and stunned.... all ate in erie silence.....

Last night, while we watched the press conference with the President, there was utter discust, and the common feeling amongst us all that we soldiers are now the loneliest people on Earth.... we fight an enemy over here, and we have a country full of enemies to go home to that are our countrymen. We watched President Bush say his own political funeral, our commander and chief.. as well as ours..... He tried so hard to spin it, but... well.. there is no way to soften such a morale blow.

While you sit and Monday morning quarterback what we work so hard to do for you out here, just know that the spirit of your team is wounded..... YOU liberals, you America have done a great job of demoralizing us... Thank you.

Do us a favor though, when we do come home, spare us the ceremony....... We all now know that it is a bunch of crap, and what you think of us.......

I have to say that right now, I would rather be a pussy ass Frenchman, even though they have no will to fight, at least they have the balls to make a decision and stick with it...... They stuck to thier guns about staying out of this war, even if it was the wrong decision......America on the other hand, goes off half cocked, and when the decision appears to be a hard one, or something that might cost a little bit, they turn tail and run.....

WHAT A NATION OF PUSSIES!!!!

This week I am NOT proud to say that I am an American..........I think it is obvious why... See, we just have told the world that we are not a nation of people who are tough, and will fight for what we believe in... We have told the world that we are a giant coward that will shy away from any difficult challenge...

So, while you eat your cheetos, and sit there and watch your lazy ass get fatter, dumber and happier Joe Citizen.. Just remember this, I, and all my commrades payed a dear price to come this far and have you decide that we should fail...

Realize this, because of your action this week America.... do not expect so many men to be so willing to stand up for your next little whim just to be cut down in the middle of it all............

Realize this also.. you have just put a heavy price on the heads of us all...... Now that we are branded as cowards, we are an easy target, oh so inviting for the taking....... I swore to protect your children in your beds.... yet you fling the door wide open inspite of me to invite the scourge.... Well.... have it your way then.

Because of this, September 11th will soon be overshadowed by these same enemies.. my advice to you is get your lazy, self centered ass up and make peace with your God, and your family.. cause, time will come when they may not be there for you................Because you kicked me in the teeth, and so many others, I know I won't any more..

I am a 40ish female, legal assistant, secretary, learning Spanish.","I would advise you to advertise in the local newspapers or buy them in the USA (at the West Indian Stores) and look for job openings. You should apply not only to Law Firms but to Hotels and The Alumina/Bauxite Companies. Jamaica welcomes foreign workers, and it's no hassle to get a permit to work there. You may even be able to get paid in American Dollars or if not -you can always change your Jamaican Money to US dollars by showing your US status. Also anybody whatsoever can now open a foreign exchange account which basically means your money is converted in the bank to US dollars and your interest is paid in US dollars. The money is protected from the fluctuations in the dollar-just ask at a local bank in Jamaica for details. If you are a returning resident once every three years you can declare returning resident status and be tax and duty exempt from everything you are shipping and everything you are taking with you through the airport. This even includes cars. My Uncle declared it three times and took three cars from Florida to Kingston and paid no duty or taxes.

But hey, look at it this way, you could say that the Iraqi army surrendered after we invaded, Saddam was captured and convicted, Saddam's sons were taken out, Mission Accomplished, WDMs are gone, we never lost a military battle, we gave Iraq back to the people, democracy began, and Iraq is now an ally, so if you look at it that way, we won....if we leave now, and everything goes down the tubes, it is Iraq's fault (and their neighbors) but not ours","2","2","2","2","2","1","2","2","3","2"

Its getting better each day but no matter how long i warm up, drink tea, gargle with salted water, i cant seem to get my voice strong enough to support the notes that used to be able to sing with ease.","Hi there,

I'm glad I found your question because I'm a vocalist with two music degrees, a Bm and an MM.  i've taught for 13 years and sing opera, jazz, musical theatre...You get the idea.  Anyway, here is the truth:  Bronchitus is not just an infection or inflamation like other ""itises"" in your body.  It is technically a damaging of the vocal folds, or voice box/larynx.  Inside of there, you strained the folds (like muscles) by overusing them by either coughing because of a sickness, or yelling, screaming, talking too loud, or too low or too high without support.  That's another topic (hee hee).  So like when you pull a muscle from exercising too much on a leg muscle, for instance, it takes a while for that muscle to return to normal: it hurts, stings, strains, it's weaker.  It is the exact same thing with your voice.  Even if it was 6 mos. ago, chances are you have continued to sing and talk, yell, etc.  In order for your larynx to heal, you must NOT MAKE NOISE.  I know, easier said than done but PLEASE do yourself a favor and rest it. That is what this vocal doctor orders.  Mouth everything that you can, cancel singing engagements, whatever it takes; you must take care of your 1st soprano sweetness for choir - even if it means sitting out a performance or giving away a solo.  You will get better soon.  Also, gargling: NO.  Just more noise.  Salt: NO It dehydrates your body (larynx) - not good.  Also, acidic foods are bad.  Try to cut them out.

Both of these ideas make sense, so why does it still feel so painful when someone dies?","I don't know that anyone can really explain the why part. We just do. Maybe, we feel grief because an emotional attachment, that has been a real part of our lives, has been severed. It takes a while to grasp the fact that it is temporary. We miss that persons (or pets) presence in our life. When someone I was close to, died I thought my heart would really break, that my world had come to an end, but eventually I started thinking in a different way, and it helped with the grief. Instead of thinking of it as the END, I started thinking of it like he just moved, ""upstairs,"" to heaven, before I did. I believe that there is life after death, if we are Christians we will go to heaven, and that he will be waiting for me. If you are grieving I am sorry.

"text1049AH","Should police officers be allowed to use tasers on citizens?","I have read numerous news stories across the country of police officers tasing citizens for minor reasons. If a suspect has a gun, then obviously a police officer is going to use his gun also. So why use tasers to electrocute citizens for minor reasons? According to Amnesty International, more than 144 citizens have died already after being tasered by police.","It depends upon what you consider ""minor reasons.""  A gun is not the only reason an officer would need to incapacitate a ""citizen.""  The question can only be answered on a case by case basis.  If the citizen - unarmed - is beating another citizen and won't stop despite police requests, then a taser would be appropriate to incapacitate him - the officers aren't required to get into a brawl to stop violence.  If the citizen is merely mouthing off to a police officer - then such use would be patently unlawful.  There is a huge spectrum in the middle that can't be answered with a ""pat"" answer applicable to all.","2","3","2","3","2","2","2","2","2","2"

There are many intelligent Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, but there seems to be a serious view that the USA military will always win any conflict and therefore the solution is always to “bomb, nuke or invade”.

Do these view really represent mainstream US thought ?","The American people are smart most of the time. They see the US Military as a weapon. It is probably the most powerful weapon in the world, all things considered. They know that. They also know that politicians (Americans and everyone elses) will say or do anything to get elected therefore rich. The part that frustrates most Americans is that they know that the US Military can go in and kick about anyones butt.

Think of it like you in your home with one weapon (US Military) one politician and one soldier. A group of murderers break into your home. The soldier grabs the weapon and starts killing the murderers. The politician watches until most of the murderers are dead then takes the weapon away from the soldier and tries to kill the rest ( just to look good and get reelected). Then things start to go bad. Politician can't shoot for crap doesn't know how to reload has no idea of tactics. THIS is where Americans say ""just finish them off"" with frustration. Don't blame them they know we can win.

You will be ready to fall in love again.  But it will take time.

In the meantime, the best thing that you can do is focus on yourself.  You are still there for you, and you know what makes you happy.  Build yourself up, do the things you love to do, pursue interests you may not have had time for when you were with him.  Enjoy your freedom.  It may not be easy going at first, but self love is the best healing agent around.

Children themselves are not the result of sin, they're only the unlucky inheritors of it.  Adam and Eve might have had children if they had remained in the Garden long enough, but as it was, they didn't procreate until afterwards, so that every child from there on out was endowed with a penchant for sin.

I think drivers typically do a good job, and if there is someone to blame its uaually the people who don't get the items on the truck in the first place.  Of course, they do need to be on time always, and when the delivery doesn't get made, somebody is gonna be unhappy.  If the person receiving the items have no one else to blame, I'm sure truck drivers get the grief more often than not.  Still a truck driver is not really a glamour job, as the concept that all you have to do is drive seems like something most people could do.","3","1","1","1","3","2","2","2","2","2"

Where did you come from, your parents, ancestors? And I ask the same to these people who share your beliefs: Where did you all come from? Unless you're Native American, you can tell me whatever you want, but if you're not then think before speaking because you're insulting your ancestors for coming here the same way.

You know, it seems like a load of BS to me. They were not making all those excuses when Mel Gibson said what he said about Jews. And Gibson wasn't shouting threats to a Jew. Richards was threatening actual people at his show.

Why do whites gang together, even to defend that which is indefensible? Perhaps that's the secret of their success, perhaps the right thing for all races to do is to support your own even when you know they are wrong.","The only defense I have for this twit is that this is STILL America.

"text987FR","why friendship bring more pain than love?","why we are hurt by the person we care so much?they know our weaknesses and they are taking it againts us.","Well, usually friendship doesn't bring more pain than love. Usually, friends know your weakness and then avoid them becuase of that, they care for you and do whatever they can to help you, they look out for you and never try to hurt you. But alas, not everyone is like that. Are you in a situation where your friendship is bringing more pain than love? If so, you aren't alone, i have the same thing going on. If you are in pain because of a friendship, i would suggest you approach your friend and let them know why you are feeling like you do. Don't get mad at them and blame them like ""you are the cause for my grief"" and such, approach calmy and explain why you are in pain.  For your question, the reason we are hurt by the persons we care most about it just that reason, we care more about them because we have invested so much into that relationship, so we take whatever they say or do more seriously than what a stranger may say. You tend to trust them more, so if they hurt you it hurts far more than if a stranger hurt you. I don't really know what your question is, so i can't really think about what else to say. If you want to talk or vent or whatever feel free to emial me. Whatever happens, i wish you the best of luck!

Especially those countries that provide a pension for their retired workers that need a growing workforce to fund the retirement bill. The question should maybe be, ""immigration, legal or illegal."" The majority of illegal immigrants are producing very little benefit for the host country as they pay no tax or social security.

Should they be allowed to stay? Yes if they are not going to sponge off the system and are prepared to work.  Another problem arises here though.

"text687SC","Do finite misdeeds warrant infinite punishment?","The whole concept of eternal hell does not make sense to me on a karmic level. Even according to the Old Testament it is an eye of and eye and a tooth for a tooth, not a hand for a fingernail and a chopping up of the body into bits for ever and ever, even if someone in some life did commit a grave crime such as dismemberment. I know what is going to be said that all our righteous acts are like menstrual rags to God & that in comparison to God's infinite Goodness our sin is worth infinite punishment. This does not pan out either. God cannot judge us up to his/her standard since we are not God. Only God can judge God by God's standards. Why do we treat adults differently in the legal system than juveniles? This is because we inherently know that children as less culpable since they have not reached our level yet. The best of physical world mirrors the spiritual. If we would not eternally torture our own children for some misdeed how much more would one who is infinitely kind do likewise.","Our 'misdeeds' could actually have infinite consequences, depending on who they affect.  But apart from that, the biblical idea of eternal punishment consists of eternal separation from God.  This is a just punishment since those who recieve it are ones who have already rejected God.  The way to escape this judgment has been made simple: accecpt Christ, since He has provided for the removal of our sin.   God has allowed for our faults & failures by providing a substitute who was punished on our behalf.  If we accept this then the Bible says we will always have an 'advocate' (Jesus) who will plead our case before God.  And if we sin (as we are sure to do) we have only to ask forgiveness.","2","1","2","1","2","3","2","2","2","2"

By the way, I'm not asking what you want Jesus to be.","God is the authority. We are not meant to believe things just because the pastor says so. We are to read the Bible for ourselves and pray for God to reveal the wisdom and the truth in the Bible. The ""church"" in the Bible is ALL who believe the gospel and are Christians, not some man made denomination that says, ""This is what we think about what the Bible says and we're RIGHT."" The Bible is deeper than anyone can possibly imagine. Every time you read it, you'll see something you did not see before.

Going to church serves a good and right purpose. We are to fellowship with other Christians, and we are to use church to help us learn and to worship God.

I feel that Bushco has corrupted our government and run our country into the ground by allowing high gas prices, the erosion of our good alliances and reputation with other countries, and political scandals left and right.  

However, I don't think Hillary Clinton is the right choice for President because she vacilates too much in her opinions and seems to try too hard to appeal to the middle of the road  people who tend to know nothing about real issues that affect them every day.  

I think Al Gore is primed to take our country back to the success of the nineties and lead the way in environmental reform and alternative energy sourcing - two of the LARGEST coming problems.  If you can't see them as real problems baring down on us then you are BLIND.  Osama is not the threat, disappearing oil and rising temperatures are, and Al Gore is prepared to handle all three.","The Economy is at a record high, unemployment is at a record low and wall street is at a record pace.

If you are going to places like the theater, then it would nice to wear something appropriate such as nice pair of trousers, jeans that you can dress up or down, and nice summer dress because it gets hot in the summer.

These conversions don't mean much as they seem to lose their new religion as soon as they get paroled.  The problem isn't converting to islam, they lost their new religion when they converted to christianity too.  It's much easier to get paroled if they declare a religious faith. Course, quite a few are converting to budhism, as they get fresh fruit and veggies (don't get fresh in prison without that conversion), though there are some problems with getting meat, so islam is the big popular theme now.  A lot is based strictly on ""coolness"", and right now islam is cool.  Has absolutely nothing to do with logic or common sense.  A true christian would not convert, anymore than a true muslim would convert.  If someone is converting for reasons other than getting paroled from prison, they weren't much of believers in the first place.

Since skirts and dresses don't have inseams like pants do, the leg crossing was necessary to keep others from seeing your underwear.  If you don't feel comfortable crossing your legs for whatever reason, you can sit with them together (if wearing a skirt or dress).  When wearing pants, things are much more relaxed(just don't sit spread-eagled).  Truth be told, I don't think crossing your legs is healthy in your case.

Do you have a friend who is a good photographer?  If so, get together and have him/her shoot a portfolio of some good head and full body shots.  They do not have to be fancy to start out.  Do some research and talk to anyone you know who had done modeling work to find out what agency they used.  Ask around.  You will be surprised how many people have done modeling/acting/voice over work, and not all of them are perfect looking.  Call any prospective agencies and ask any questions you have, or that your mother might have.  Maybe if you approach your mother with this beginner portfolio, and all of the research you have collected, she will see that you are smart and responsible enough to enter a career.

I have done some pretty crazy things because of that, but I love every girl that I have been with.  I have never needed porn while in a relationship.  When I had urges, she was always there, but that was because we were so open with eachother.  And if you do everything for him, and he is just addicted, maybe you can look at it with him and try to fulfill some of the fantasies he has while looking at porn.  It is always hot when a girl gets turned on by something that turns the guy on.  I guarantee if you do that, he will turn away from the screen and focus all his attention on you.  Eventually he won't need porn anymore, he will always and only fantasize about you!!!","2","2","1","1","3","1","2","1","3","2"

I am traveling in August and the tickets right now are somewhat less than they have been in the past month. I am still pretty far out from my travel date though. Shough I buy now or wait a few more weeks?","The further out you book the better.  They just raised fares this week.  Delta raised fares in First Class and full fare coach by $50 and everyone else followed suit.  Fares go up in August and in the fall when summer travel is over.  The closer to the time of departure the more it goes up.  If it is a highly traveled destination the discount fares sell out fast.  Try to book no less than 30 days in advanced in order to receive the best price and schedule options.  Prices are always subject to change and so they could sell at one rate this week, be cheaper the next and double the next week.  Usually it only goes up the closer you get.  But if a price war starts, which the often can, you need to jump on it then.  If August is your travel time, Id book with in the next 2 weeks or so.  Kids go back to school, they are flying back from their divorced parents, going back to college or prep school.  So just keep that in mind, there is a lot of traffic going back home or back to school in August.  So...if you see a decent price, go ahead and grab it now.  Its most likely going to only go up.","1","2","2","1","3","3","3","2","2","3"

They have been working and doing embryonic stem cell research for 13 years and spending billions of dollars on it.

In all that time, there have been ZERO breakthroughs. . 

zero discoveries . . 

The kind of stem cell research Talent and the other Republicans Fox is lying about HAVE voted for spending tax money on is ""adult stem cell research""

which HAS brought dozens of cures. . 

it has resulted in 72 different clinical cures, while Embryonic stem cell research has resulted in NONE!

he doesn't tell you that part.","Thank you Amy for saying what I was noticing.  A lot of people glibly say they are for stem cell research without knowing much about it.

But if that is true, then their is no room for free-will because everything is just a result of what happened beforehand and everything that can happen does happen.  The way I see it, the tricky part is that we don't have the capacity to understand all of the causal factors that contribute to our current conditions and we don't have perfect memories to recall all our experiences, so it seems that we have free-will.

The germans used Blitzkrieg war, which totally caught the world by suprise, waiting for another trench war.  The Polish army was actually quite large compared to the german army, but the Germans used a combination of quick thrusting tanks, divebombers, mobile infantry and paratroopers to completely surround and demoralize the enemy.  The German military staff, before Hitler's wonderful purges which slaughtered many genius strategists who were though to be unloyal, was amazing.  Germany had the best military minds in the world at the start of world war II, with better generals arguably only in the U.S.  Germany was able to take on the world through intensely unorthodox tactics, brave nationalistic soldiers who were excellently trained and armed, and an enemy that was still using policies of appeasement (giving aggressive nations what they want to continue peace).

"text1997PG","Does anyone know about real estate property lines?","We just bought a house in Oct. 05 and just now found out that part of my garage is on another homeowners property. The builder we bought it from built this garage and had it surveyed. What legal rights do I have in persuing the builder/surveyor? Do I have any rights in suing them?  I'm totally lost--get a lawyer to help??","Good answer by Rosemary. You do need to consult a lawyer, and you also need to verify the survey, by having a different licensed professional land surveyor check the survey that shows the problem, since that first survey could be incorrect. If it turns out that the garage really is over the property line, you will probably be able to recover damages from the developer. The developer may accept responsibility, or they may seek to recover damages from the surveyor who made the mistake that created the problem, depending upon what happened at the time of construction.

However, you do not need to do any of this until your neighbor raises the issue. If your neighbor does not insist that you either tear down the garage, or pay them for occupying a piece of their property, then you do not need to do anything. It is your neighbors responsibility to act to defend their property rights. If they fail to act, you may not have a problem at all, even if the garage is over the line. There are thousands of situations like this all over the country. Land surveyors discover these situations every day. In many cases, the neighbors have simply agreed to accept the situation as it is, especially if they are friends, and the situation has existed for years with no problem.

"text1286PG","Why Does The Media Lie? And is The Independent Media: A Myth?","The role played by the corporate structure of the Mass Media in the  <br/>“manufacture of consent”, as a means of population control, is reflected in its faithful propagation of the established opinion that Western policy is fundamentally benevolent in intention, is an issue of paramount importance. What role has the media played in clarifying the real principles and motives of Western policy to the public, and what does this entail for the nature of Western democracy and the role of the population in the formulation of policy? The mass media is clearly one of the most powerful institutions in society; it is, for most of the public, the ultimate source of all their information. The structure of the mass media will therefore have fundamental implications for the political and cultural orientation of the public.","It depends on what the media is reporting on. If the media is reporting on anything having to do with foreign affairs or internal government affairs, most of the media gets their info from the AP (associated press) who in turn get their info from government briefs. Plus the media/journalists/broadcasters etc have fought for their freedom of expression many a time in the history of this country. If it weren't for the media half of the scandals that occurred i.e. watergate, the people would not have known that they even occurred.

Also, Japanese people exercise a lot and, as evidenced by the extremely clean city of Tokyo, keep their homes clean, thus clearing it of disease-causing pathogens. They are also very focused and industrious, which contributes to their spiritual and mental health. Their custom of school on Saturdays also contributes to their mental health, as does their tradition of learning music at an early age (music helps the mind, spirit, and body thrive). I'd say Japan. I mean, compare it to other cultures. Italy? China? The United States?

As hard as it will be, try to put their judgements to the back of your mind and fight back by concentrating on your schoolwork and setting realistic goals for yourself. If you do this you will reach them one at a time. Each goal reached is an achievement and will assist in re establishing some belief in yourself. Kelly you must believe in yourself.

For me personally, I think it's a load of sh*t. Obesity isn't a handicap. REAL handicapped people, like people in wheelchairs, need those spots. And it's not because the spots are closer to the location, it's because they have pedestrian walking areas next to them, so a wheelchair ramp can be extended out of the car (van/truck) and the wheelchair can get out.<br/>I don't even know how doctors can give placards to morbidly obese people. The last thing they should do is be able to park closer to the KFC.<br/>There are some rare exceptions where the person's weight cannot be controlled by the person, but for the rest that got fat by sitting around doing nothing but eat all day, that is no reason.

What do you think?","As awful as this is going to sound, I'm going to have to agree with you.  Obesity, in the vast majority of cases, is preventable, curable, and definitely at least improvable- although it may take a lot of time and effort.  People who are truly disabled, such as those in wheelchairs, can't help it- at least not to a level where they won't need the special accomodations.  On the other hand, it is possible for a morbidly obese person to get down to a weight where he/she can certainly walk like others, sit in regular movie seats, etc.  Therefore, the handicapped permits and parking spaces should go to those who will really need them.","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","1","2"

Please answer my question, what is wrong with the world!?!","Nothing is wrong with the world. Everything follows from the true nature of things, which I think is the will to power. The problem (and I'm not even saying it is ""wrong"") is with your worldview. You seem to have a false belief in ""free will"". Those people you mention are *not* free to act that way, be that way. Is the lion ""free"" to kill or not kill gazelles? Is the sun free to become or not become a supernova when its time comes? I think not. People are rational animals, animals are living things, and all things are part of this giant process that nothing can change in the least. And what does ""rational"" mean? Does it not mean ""able to rationalise the irrational""? I have just rationalised the madness of the world. I have not changed anything thereby. My rationalisation is part of the madness. ""Do not judge unless thee be judged"" is a profound wisdom, because in judging and condemning the world you have judged and condemned yourself. Nothing wrong with that, though.","3","1","1","1","2","1","3","2","2","2"

Your likes and dislikes,  What pisses you off?  etc. What will make you stay faithful?  Big word I know, but please I really want to know.  Please answer this from your heart.  Thanks!","Good looks are a bonus - but I prefer what's inside, her personality, her inteligence and her compasion.  There has to be a spark, a level of trust and a deep friendship.

As for faithfulness - it's down to choice, my current gf know's my past record and I have chosen to be totally faithful to her because it would hurt her if I wasn't - even though I would tell her and be honest about it, and I wuld be honest about it because I just can't lie to her and it would hurt her more to discover later that I had lied.","2","2","3","3","2","3","1","2","2","2"

It is also located Center Strip so you are never far from anything. As far as how long to stay, I think you can go for three weeks and still not see everything.

Jesus being born (I know he probably wasn't born on the 25th December) is the real meaning of Christmas.  I agree there is too much emphasis on giving really expensive presents and over indulging.  Its a great time to meet family and friends who you are probably too busy to visit during the year.

There are probably a few exceptions to this.  There was some form of local administration with the original colonies,  so that is the eastern most states, and Florida.  Also, Texas was an independent nation before joining the Union, so I believe it had some local forms of government.  Hawaii had a monarchy system, and is relatively Small, so I do not think it.  As for the vast majority that went the route of territory to state, for the most part they were administered as an entire territory under a civilian organization directly under Congress.  I do not believe there was any sort of county governments.  There were town councils and sheriffs, but nothing on a more organized level.","2","1","2","1","2","3","1","3","2","2"
"text754AH","Does something that has to be pimped have a valid claim to be the ultimate truth?","It seems like the less reason there is to believe in something, the more it's proponents have to tell you how great it is.  I have yet to have a physics student come to my door to try to get me to accept gravity and hand me a book by Einstein when I tell them I really don't want to talk about it.  If something is the truth, shouldn't it be so obvious that pimps aren't necessary to promote it?","I think that would depend upon the subject.  Gravity can be seen by the human eye.  Thus, proven to be true.  something on more of a level of faith, i.e. God, may have to be preached.  God can not be seen, or touched.  Only a persons faith, teachings and beliefs are depended upon.  With as many negative and evil forces in the world today, I can see were faith needs to be preached and the humanity reminded of a higher power and the rewards thereof.  It is been proven that Jesus lived.  Many things mentioned in the bible have been found and proven to have existed.  Yet, there are still non-believers.  People tend to be skeptical of the unseen or unknown.  Thus it must be preached or as you say pimped.","3","1","2","2","1","2","2","3","2","2"

In the future there will be two clear choices between following God's Word on certain issues or listening to the beast power instead. The majority will go with this, but the majority will be wrong. The mark will not necessarily be a literal one, but will be in the forehead and in the right hand according to scripture-these can symbolize our minds and what affects our jobs. (Most people are right-handed for their work.) This is a heavy topic that deserves study in God's Word, with good guidance. See the following website for more info. Believe me, God will not allow us to be in ignorance on these matters if we really want to know about them.

"text1881FR","what to do when your not in love anymore?","How do you tell your spouse you love them but.....your not in love anymore.","After the first 4 years of your body bombarding you with levels of ""Dopamine"" it switches gears to a laid back, less excited drug called ""Oxytocin"". Here's where the ""real work"" in  a marriage comes into play. You need to relearn him, become his best friend again, find new and exciting things about him. Deepen your relationship and infuse some excitement into your marriage. The LAST option you consider should be divorce. That's a cop out if done before everything else. Just because you attend marriage counseling doesn't mean it's ending. When you take your car for a tune up does it mean your getting rid of it? No. Just means there's been some wear and tear and you need to tweak things to get your motors running better. Talk with him first. Tell him your thoughts and fears. But follow it up with suggestions on how you can improve and better your bond. Your grandparents didn't make it that far because they went from relationship to relationship constantly seeking that continual euphoric feeling of new love.

"" Hey, just say Lord Im sorry and do whatever you want to do."" Where are the real Christian programs? Besides the preachers preaching in pulpits.

Please vent here.","I can't really vent, since I didn't have a problem. I liked the episode. I only saw the last 30 minutes, and it was pretty good. I liked how Eric was bargaining with God, because EVERYONE does that when confronted with bad news. I was shocked with Annie's vulgarity, but it also shows we all slip up.

I think our politician and yours don't like each other, but we, French people, remember for example what your boys did during WWII, as we hope you remember what we did during your independance war. Are our people friends for ever or not? Thanks","My sense is that Americans feel that French are snooty towards Americans as well as being ingrates with regards to the rescues at Normandy during WW 2. The French government has resisited the influence of American culture within France by creating laws for example that punish radio stations for playing American music or for speaking in English. On the international relations front there was the denial of airspace issues in regard to our attacks on the country of Libya on April 15, 1986. Americans felt sold out by the French who we perceived as caving in to the Muslim minority in the country. Then of course, the Iraq war. France moved from passive resistance to active opposer to the USA's efforts within Iraq. Of course France with its long history of colonial activity is certainly not one to talk. Aside from that in my view the French are a great culture with a great history, a great language (which is so pleasant to hear), very forward views on human relations. I don't like the cuisine because its all about butter, cream and heavy stuff (do people eat like that anymore?). France also gave us the modern fashion we hold so dearly. I think there is hope for relations between our countries. Perhaps we both need to swallow our pride.","2","1","3","2","3","2","2","1","2","2"

Instead of talking pullout they should be taking about firing some generals and military leaders for not getting the job done.

I just need more reasons!","If you want to genuinely be persuasive you'll have to address the reasons it does help, and the instances in which it helps in addition to those in which it does not. Focusing on a particular type of aid would be more persuasive, such as that from the World Bank and IMF, which comes with strings attached that cause serious harm to the poor by forcing governments to cut programs that help them. The Gates Foundation and various micro-lending programs, on the other hand, do a lot of good. So perhaps end your essay suggesting that the focus be on smaller community-based aid instead of large handouts to corrupt governments.","2","3","3","3","1","3","3","3","2","3"

1) Churchill was an idiot. He declared war on Hitler over Poland which now incidentally belongs to Russia. Hitler actually wanted to be friends with England and Russia was his goal. Churchill didn't give a fig about the Jews either. They had nothing to do with Churchill's decision. In fact he didn't lift a finger to help them.

2) Japan was at war with China two years before the European war started. In WW1 they were on our side. They changed sides after the idiot Yanks interfered with the China war by embargoing Japan. They had won the war against China after thousands of years and this upstart British colony tries to starve them. No wonder they bombed pearl harbour! If not for Yankee interference the Japanese wouldn't have been a threat to Australia. Stupid Yanks!","Although Russia did take Berlin, Hitler lost the war for himself. Hitler through careful research and video evidence, it is believed hitler had Parkinsons because he took speed to often. Hitler then knew he was going to die, and opened up war on all fronts. Hitler's troops were too exhausted spread out and weary to protect, Germany on 4 different war fronts (east and west europe britian air raids, and Africa.) Hitler, has a peace treaty with Russia, he attacked russia. America actually won the race to berlin, but stalin told the Americans he wanted to take berlin and The Americans agreed. It was more Hitlers fault that he lost the war.  Russians had a major part, but without the American help, Hitler wouldve massacred everything in Russia. It was the winter of '44 (i wanna say) where the tide changed because he troops were ill equiped for Cold combat. It was a combined effort, but if we must agree on something France did jack sh*t except surrender.","2","1","2","1","3","2","1","2","1","1"

I want to go to america and work and travel about preferably in hospitality, ideally on a cruise ship. I've noticed heaps of companies that want heaps of money to find you work/sponsorship over there, however i'm a bit sceptical of them.","I'm sure there's a ton of ways to somehow wiggle your way into a job in America, but here's something that might work for your situation. What you could do is apply for a university there and complete your finance degree there. Depending on the school you're currently in, you might be able to transfer a lot of your credits over so you don't have to start from scratch. After you obtain your degree, you will automatically be given a practical training work permit that allows you to legally work for any employer for a year. Once you get your foot in the door, all kinds of possibilities are available. For one, your employer could sponsor you for a long term visa or green card. You could also start a business of your own. If your business is able to sustain a certain number of employees for a year (I believe it is 6 employees) you'll be able to sponsor yourself through your business. I guess they allow this because you're creating jobs for Americans.","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","3","3"

For most people it's a wrong decision, you miss out on soo much even setting aside career and college. So much responsibility comes with having a child, and I am assuming you mean that a husband comes along with that child.

The United States Congress starts with a prayer, state legislatures start with prayers, and City Councils start with prayer so it is not shocking that these Board meetings start with prayers.

Basically, tax payers pay for so much of childrens developement by the time they are ready to work and pay back taxes.. where as immigrants come to the country with ready to work and pay taxes.. and with new business ideas that create jobs.

My favorite is the one where a couple just got married and the groom is pushing ice aside with his fingers trying to find a beer in a large galvanized tub.  The bride walks up dives head first into the tub and starts fishing around to find a beer.  After about 10 seconds she comes up with one and gives it to the groom.  Then on the other end of the spectrum we get the half hour info-mercials for Nads.  That one makes it look like Aussie women are so hairy that they would make a gorilla feel bald.  Personally I found the women down there are like women all over, they all have their own different personality traits and come in all shapes and sizes.","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","2","3","2"

As Governor, Bush got to ceremonially act as a state trooper for a day. While operating a speed trap Bush pulled over a Texas farmer. He lectured the farmer about his speed and the necessity of obeying laws made by his superiors, and in general threw his weight around. Finally, he got around to writing the ticket, and as he was doing so he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing around his head. The farmer said, ""Having some problems with circle flies there, are ya, Sir?"" Bush stopped writing the ticket and said, ""Well yeah, if that's what they are -- I never heard of circle flies."" So the farmer says, ""Well, circle flies are common on farms. See, they're called circle flies because they're almost always found circling around the back end of horses."" Bush says, ""Oh,"" and goes back to writing the ticket. After a minute he stops and slowly says, ""Hey... wait a minute, are you trying to call me a horse's ass?"" The farmer says, ""Oh no, Governor, I have too much respect for you to even think about calling you a horse's ass."" Grinning broadly, Bush says, ""Well, that's a good thing,"" and goes back to writing the ticket. After a long pause, the farmer says, ""Hard to fool them flies though.""","3","3","3","3","2","1","1","1","2","1"

One of my friends is involved with acting in musicals and dramas, buts thats not really what I want to do.  I'm really interested in commericials, TV show, movies, etc.  Its not something I want to do as a career in the long run, but I want to try.  I know to start in commercials, but I'm not sure where to find casting calls.  I've looked it up on the internet, but some of it seems ""shady.""

One or two sites I found gave the lists of the casting, most of which I haven't heard of.  The others, claim to give you fame, if you either pay, or give out you picture and telephone number.  That doesn't seem right, either.

Where can I find a good, reliable source?","There is no one reliable source nor is there one answer about how to do this.  Acting is a profession like any other. If you're not prepared to take it seriously then don't even try.  Sounds like you're looking for a fast buck.  A better plan would be lottery tickets.  It's very hard to find work.  If you want to do it anyway, you should and you will.  If you don't live in N.Y or L.A. or some smaller market where there are actually jobs forget it.  Or move.

Take classes and workshops and do theatre.  You need to learn how to act first.  Would you try to do any other professional job without training?  You'll learn about the business from the people in your classes.  And your instincts were dead right about paying anyone.  Don't.  To educate yourself about the business end go to a big bookstore.  You can get started anyway.  And avoid open casting calls.  If you're not called with a specifc time to come in, it's not an audition.  It doesn't work that way.

Yet it is not life threatening if someone doesn't understand the meaning of life, ways and means to survive weigh heavier in that sense.

Personally I've noticed that living life goes smoother without question. Though for me the meaning of life can be brought back to the word improvement, on a personal level but also as a part of humanity and of life in general. When there no longer is room for improvement this will result in death and on the level of a species it will come down to extinction.

Insula","You may have put this as a flippant question, but I will answer the question about the animals vs humans being gay from the Bible. Humans are different than the animals. Animals were simply spoken into existence in the creation story. Man, on the other hand, was formed out of the dirt, then God breathed into them a spirit. The animals did not get this. God didn't create 2 males or 2 females, but made them unique and complimentary to each other. It has been shown that men's brains have different properties than women's (less communication between the hemispheres, less development of the language area). That doesn't make them inferior, just different. Men focus better on 1 task, where women are cooking supper, corralling the kids, and thinking about what needs to be done for the upcoming vacation--they can do that with their abilities. Men have the current time in view, women plan ahead more (at least in my family). That gives a different perspective on life.

Easter is actually an ancient spring/harvest festival that was ""absorbed"" by Christianity to denote the rebirth/resurrection of Jesus.  Spring is a rebirth of the world after winter and early Christians thought that this festival went well with the rebirth of Jesus.   This also helped Christians convert many pagan tribes by allowing them to keep vestiges of their old religion.   Christianity is full of these hybrid stories and festivals.   The resurrection is a new spin on the story of Osiris.  Noah is a retelling of the Epic of Gilgamesh.   The list is huge...","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","1","3","3"

Well I didn't get any sleep after this happened because I couldn't quit freaking out.<br/>The main reason being that this is my 3rd ticket in 6 months. The previous two were for speeding. The other cars were doing like 70 mph. I just happened to be in the far left lane and passed the state trooper's car, which was parked against the median. I didn't realize I was going 80 until I saw the lights in my rear view mirror. Why? because all the other cars were travelling just a couple miles per hour below mine!! The possible penalties for this misdemeanor are mind boggling! I can't quit thinking about it! I'm stressed out, paranoid, and unable to focus at work!

Perhaps sign up for some kind of safe driving course before you go to court for this one. Ask the judge for leniency since you are trying to learn to drive slower and see what happens.

Segergation in all its forms came from the bible while in school, against people of jewish, islamic, and budist faith, aganist homosexuals, etc, and people had to concel themselves from the world around them, while in school drugs new were introduced such as lsd in the 1930s, herione, etc, these were all things that didnt have restrictions untill a certain point, the only thing ppl dont think about is the fact nothing was wrong back then other then things that were out of the norm. lsd was used buy pshycologist, and it and other drugs could be oder out of a catalog, you werent suppose to be gay, jews killed Jesus which intitled them to be abused, and if you noticed that the moment they baned the bible from school they also baned alot of other thing, then at that point you begin","Once one learns the true origin of the bible then one can figure out why all the problems.  Bible was placed in the hands of the sheeple in order to control an manipulate them.  Bible is a source of info that was and is geared towards steering the sheeple away from the truth of their real self.  All religion is false but has it's purposes.  When one becomes truly aware that humans are not on top of the food chain, then and only then can they truly understand the deceptions of religions.   Since you take the bible teachings out of school, the true rulers have less opportunity to brainwash and manipuate children before they become adults, therefor less control of them.  At the same time those same children don't get any idea of what's really going on about the true nature of reality physical and spiritual.  So most of them become out of control and the great manipulators have to find other ways of steering the sheeple, mainly through fear.   Humans are manipulated much like cows, pigs, horses etc... on a more sophisticated level, one just has to wake up and want to see the real truth, which  most prefer to keep their heads deeply buried into the sand.

I have learned about mussolini in my history calss and never knew when he died and I was curious onhow he died.","While the allies where liberating northern Italy, Mussolini fled from Milan with his lover Claretta Petacci and some other fascist leaders. His original idea was to reach Switzerland, but on his way he met a group of German soldiers that offered to escort him to Sudtirol (Alto Adige in Italian) that had been annexed to the Reich and in that moment was a part of Germany. On their way they were stopped by some Italian partisans that recognized Mussolini even if he was disguised, wearing a German uniform. The partisans captured him and his lover and let the Germans go. The prisoners where kept Dongo, where they were shot by a partisan whose battle name was ""Valerio"" on april 28. He had received the order to shoot Mussolini from the CLN - Italian Liberation Committee, the partisans' headquarters, because otherwise he should have been handed over to the allies. It looks like killing Claretta Petacci was an idea of Valerio alone. The corpses were then carried to Milan and then hung in Piazzale Loreto, where some Germans and Fascist had killed a group of partisans during the nazi occupation.","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","1","3"

Please answer if u know thanx","There will definitely be more 'motion' on a smaller aircraft than on a larger one like a 747. Smaller cars have stiffer suspension, usually, while larger cars 'float' to deaden road vibrations, so that might explain you being prone to motion sickeness in smaller cars. Remember that smaller airplanes, like a 172 which may be your trainer, also are much louder and vibrate more than a ride in coach class, so your senses will be a little more overwhelmed than in a connecting flight from Vegas to Dallas. So yeah, if large aircraft bother you, I think smaller ones will do the same. There are pills however that help with motion sickness to some extent.

I used Singlesnet but it was about 25 dollars a month to be able to email as many girls as I wanted. There are some free ones out there though.

After much trial and error, I found that it was best to exchange instant messenger addresses like Yahoo Chat or MSN. Chatting is better than emailing back and forth because it's too easy to get depressed if she doesn't answer you right away. There are more guys on there than girls so it's harder to get as many responses to your emails. For every 10 girls I wrote, I got 2 who answered. It was enough though. I had to go on 6 dates before I found a girl who actually liked a shy guy like me. Don't worry too much about improving your social skills if you can't. Your personality is already in place by the time you're 5 years old. It's not only about her liking you. You have to like her. Try to go some place fun for the first date like an amusement park or bowling alley. That way if it doesn't go that well, at least you'll have some fun. I think what I was doing wrong was I wasn't having enough eye contact. If you like the girl, try to show it by looking into her eyes when talking.

Before anyone say's anything. BEEN THERE DONE THAT with the Therapists, tutors etc. Nothing's helped and her anxiety is getting worse. School is being sorly affected and Math is her weakest subject. She's had school tutor's, help from her math teacher, help from myself and my husband and yet; no matter what she still say's she doesn't get it and she can't do it or that she can't remember how to do it. Even for the most simple problems it becomes a shouting match to try to get her to snap out of the mind block she gets when she starts to panic or have an anxiety attack. I'm at my wits ends now. She's now been ""FLAGGED"" going into 5th grade this fall. This means the teachers know she's not a trouble maker but a child with specific problems. ANY IDEAS other than a darn shrink to help her through all this? She's got an ulser now because of all this","Is there a lot of stress and anxiety going on in the family? Are there a lot of arguments, shouting or yeiing in the family or maybe quiet unhappiness or discontent? Do you or your husband yell at her or become frustrated or unhappy with her or witht each other a lot? If so, stop it! A lot of children are sensitive to problems in the family even when these problems are not voiced. Apart from that, is your daughter on any medication that might have an affect on her behaviour? Have your daughter tried meditation, breath awareness, yoga or taichi - all of which will help her learn to gain control of herself and learn to calm herself.","2","2","1","1","3","2","3","1","2","2"

I have always kind of supported Isreal based on the belief that Jews should have a home country based on what happened during WWII. I have friends that argue that it would be like the Native Americans saying we want our land back and fighting over it hundreds of years later.  <br/>I am certianly no expert in the conflict, nor do I pretend to understand why people would fight so hard over a small strip of what appears to be sand........","I can understand both sides: the country belonged to the jews in former times. After WWII they needed a place to stay. But imagine - you are sitting in your own house with your family - watching TV. Suddenly soldiers walk into your living room with a couple of strangers telling you: half of the living room plus the backyard are not yours anymore but will from now on belong to the newly arrived strangers. They had owned the country 300 years ago. And by the way: we will now put a fence in your living room. Sad that the TV set is on the wrong side... bye bye...

Both Israelis and Palestines need to find a way of living together and forget about the past.","1","1","3","1","3","1","2","3","2","2"

Try Homosassa Springs. Although there is no ""swim with the manatees"" program, you can rent a boat (very cheaply) and motor on down to the springs. Near the Homosassa Springs Park, you can go no further, but you can hop out of the boat--and snorkel or swim around. You will no doubt see many Manatees, but do not touch them as that is against the law...so is harrassing them in any manner. There are a plethora of boat rentals in the area. Then motor up river to a local restaurant, or try your luck fishing, cuz the river takes you all the way to the Gulf.

Sometimes really hard to find music is part of an out of print collection and they may be able to get what you are looking for as a special order. For example, if you are looking for a baroque aria from a really old opera, they may not have the vocal score, but they may have the full score of the opera, and they can give you a quote on what it would cost to give you a reduction for voice and piano of an specific section of the entire work.

But I would like to understand the exact procedure so that I can offer the fruits as well.  People in my temple speak many languages and some are not good with English.  So I'm always reluctant to just ask.

Any other info you can give me on Temple practices would be most welcome.  Thanks!","Well, I would ask, but that's just me. I do understand the hesitancy given the language barrier. So, short of asking, I would do THIS (because I don't know either, but I've been in similar situations like the first time I went to a Catholic Mass) ... Walk slow. Follow people that look and act like they've been there and done this before. Follow their example. Maybe even ask some one if you CAN follow them. Pick a kind face. Or just hang back and watch for awhile. Learn from the folks who are there in a nonverbal way. Couldn't hurt. And Hinduism being the kind of faith it is, if you're being respectful, I don't think anyone will go off on you. They'll be caught up in what they're doing, not you.

Sometimes people are forced to resign from their jobs because their bosses threaten them with termination, but they do not realize that they may have a few more rights.  The moment your supervisor mentions termination then you need to demand the right to see your union rep.  Actually, you should postpone any meeting that may led to further discipline until a union rep can be with you at the proceeding.  If you do not have a union representative then maybe you could hire a lawyer and fight to be reinstated or have some sort of compensation.  However, it is often best to move on after leaving a position where you were fired because a dozen windows can often open once you have closed a door.

Pilots use it often.  Another thing I always like to do when visiting is have 2 watches.  One for the local time and one on your home time.  Live by the home time one and make adjustments as nessesary to the local time.  In other words if you normally go to bed at 10p your home time, even if its 7p local, still go to bed then.  This helps keep your body more in sinc.  And the last thing I do is if going for an extended or permanent stay it to do just the opposite of the last statement and slowly start living on the new local time.  Just remember that you still gotta eat right during this and then a light meal the day of or evening before the flight.  Hope this helps.","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","1","2","2"

Until we can undo some of the damage of polutions caused by us; I am wondering why nothing is being done in the interim.","There are alot of projects working to help promote the growth of reefs. Unfortunately, preserving them isn't as simple as covering them up. It would halt growth and enclose and choke out the species that live there and eventually kill off the animals that called it home.

"text1929AH","Top generals of all time?","I am looking for opinions on who are, IN YOUR opinion (not Hollywood's or Wikipedia's), the most admirable generals of all time. By that, I mean generals that have displayed leadership, bravery, strategic and tactical genious, and political savy. My current list in chronological order is:

Alexandros the Great<br/>Publuis Cornelius Scipio Africanus<br/>Gaius Iulius Caesar<br/>Cao Cao of Wei (pronounced Tsao Tsao)<br/>Jinghis Khan<br/>King Gutav Adolphus of Sweden<br/>the Duke of Malborough<br/>Napoleon Bonaparte<br/>Tecumsah Sherman<br/>Erich Von Manstein

Honorary mentions: Louis Davout, Ike Eisenhower, Hannibal Barca, Wallenstein, King Frederick the Great, the Grand Duke of Alba, Heinz Guderian, Zhukov, Von Molkte the Elder, General Lee, Hernan Cortes, Subotai, Pompeius Magnus, Tamerlan, Erwin Rommel, Oda Nobunaga.

10 points to the one with the best answer who doesn't use wikipedia.","I only saw General Grant listed in one answer, which surprised me.  I would consider him the greatest general of all time, myself, at least in American history.  I would have to disagree with the choices of Washington and Lee; they both serve as powerful and enduring symbols, but as military leaders they would rank near the bottom, because they lost more battles than they won--Lee, of course, is also discounted because he was a traitor.  One person's choice of Benedict Arnold is interesting, but despite his many merits, I doubt he would make many historian's top 100 list of generals for obvious reasons; the choice of Jackson by the same person is puzzling, though he did perform brilliantly at New Orleans, I guess.  I would also agree with Sherman, and also add Stonewall Jackson, who contributed to many of Lee's victory's; also Patton, ""Hap"" Arnold, and (grudgingly) MacArthur.

I don't know many of the foreign leaders you mentioned, but I would rank Alexander and Napoleon high; also the Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, and Montgomery from WWII; and Norman Schwarzkopf.","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","1","3","3"

Find out about the job possibilities, the cost of living, the crime rate and the artistic community.

Talk to the locals and find out what they like and don't like about the city.  Then, once you have narrowed down your choices, start applying for jobs.

It’s kind of a phobia where they think that Hispanics are going to continue to grow enormously and take over the culture of the USA. They don’t like the idea of people speaking Spanish and not knowing what they are talking about. Its alienation in there own country. US citizens don’t what to have to adjust there way of life to accommodate the culture change that is taking place with the issue of immigration. Race plays a role because when you talk about the immigration issue, people often refer to Latinos. But its not just white people who resent illegal immigration, blacks do too. Blacks know that they will no longer be the larges group of minorities in this country in a few more years to come. I feel that this is an important moment in this country history because we witnessing a culture shift. These new immigrants’ illegal or not are growing.

I can't believe anybody thinks his death will end the fight for freedom in Iraq. New leaders will rise and take his place. Look at Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh died long beofre the US lost that war. Hamas lost two leaders in less than a month and yet won the elections in Palestine. 

One day the US may even kill Bin Laden. Yes, there will be much American celebration then, but would the fighting end?

Be real, this is a momentary set back, if that.

Speculation on my part is that his own people turned him in (perhaps even Bin Laden).    Which may mean friends, that the US of A just paid a 25 million dollar reward to Al Queda for terminating (firing) one of it's own.

Just being situational.","I don't really care what others think, I would just think it's funny!

Always missing them, when there not around? or  thinking  they are the only one for you?","What you're talking about is the emotional side, which can cause you to make some really irrational decisions. Love is much deeper than that. True love is when two people respect and have high expectations of each other and for each other. Not wanting to harm  or manipulate each other. One not wanting to coerce the other into doing things that they don't want to do, or are not ready for. When someone is always kind and concerned about you, and your concerns. Someone who wants to help you reach your goals; and gives you their undivided attention. When your love doesn't fade but grows stronger, no matter how much adversity comes, that not even illness will turn them away. I think that's the type of love everyone searches for, but is afraid to expect and we end up settling for much less.","1","2","1","1","2","3","2","3","3","3"

I love how authors will put something in that doesnt have signifigance untill the end or at least later part and it make you sit back and think ""OH! so thats why so-and-so did this, cleaver!... she was playing them from the start""  and how an author can incorporate so many different conflicts without losing sight of the origional story. my question: how do i write an outline for a novel. how much should i put in it. what shouold i put in it. how do i come up with all those little plot twists along the way. if ive got a good begining idea, how do i develope that enough for the outline.. etc. any sites or advice from authors? please and thankyou!","As a writer myself, I have learned that writers approach their craft in very individual ways. While there is more or less a right way to write a query or a book proposal, how you get your book written is up to you. There are lots of good books on how to write. But don't get hung up on reading a lot of books on how to write, just start writing! Start with compelling characters. Sometimes plot develops as you write, and then you can go back and tweak things to fit the end. But it's a long process in learning to write well. So if you are blocked on the outline part, outlining may not work for you. I can outline fine in my technical writing. But it doesn't work for me in fiction at all. So I don't use them.","3","2","3","3","2","2","2","3","3","3"

Directors will look for people who can stay calm under pressure and think on their feet. They will also look for people who can take direction, so if they ask you to change something during your reading, DO IT. In my experience, when a director asks an auditioner to do something differently, it is because they like them and want to see how flexible they are. Also, make sure to bring your own interpretation to the role. It is easy to watch other auditions and then try to react to what you see others doing, but bring your own self to the role you are reading for. Most importantly, have fun! It is challenging, but no play is fun if you are too hard on yourself.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"

That is such a good idea. You could say every seat is allowed x number of pounds- including yourself and your luggage. However, the number of articles of clothing that a heavier person can bring would get exponentially smaller since their clothes are bigger and therefore heavier. A baby could bring their entire wardrobe since they are tiny and their clothes are tiny and light. Of course the baby and the fatty could trade luggage and everyone could be happy.

To answer your question- they don't do that because that would make the fat people angry and then that particular airline wouldn't have any fat customers and since we live in America and lots of people are fat then they would have very few customers and they would go out of business.","1","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"

If they do offer a reading, offer them a gift or donation for their service, DO NOT demand to pay them, that would be insulting.

Shouldn't they rather make you go to a traffic class probate or suspend you license for a while, wouldn't that be more relevant and effective to take away one's driving privilages than to hit you in the pocket whichs hurts the economy and making people get desperate to scrap for money and have to appear in court six weeks later only to end up paying the fine?","In most jurisdictions one has the opportunity of going to traffic school for a first offense.  When they don't learn to follow the rules in the school, there is no point in having them repeat the school.  So, courts and legislatures try to make it expensive enough that drivers start following the rules of the road.    It is certainly ethical.  I agree with you that it is not very effective in that some people just never learn.  However, just because the laws against murder don't stop all people from murdering doesn't mean we should repeal the prohibition against murder.  Similarly, just because traffic laws are not 100 percent effective doesn't mean we should do away with them.","3","2","3","3","1","3","3","2","3","3"

I was never fortunate enough to see a geisha show, however, among the Japanese people that I knew, it wasn't a popular thing. I of course asked about it, but IF my Japansese friends KNEW much about it-they didn't know MUCH about it.  There are SOOO many types of sake...hot and cold.  I tried it once but didn't like it. And the strength also depends on the type you get.  I didn't try sushi.  I don't like fish, however, my husband is convienced that EVERYTHING called sushi in America is not sushi.  He became obsessed in Japan and I think he's sad now because he can't find any as good here in America.  I would strongly advise that you visit Japan. It's a wonderful place with a majority of the people being wonderful and kind to you. My friends were amazing and I find myself missing them already.","1","2","1","1","2","3","2","1","2","2"

One particularly bad evening, I was very close to doing something terrible, I sat on the floor and cried, saying a very simple but desperate prayer (one that I hardly expected to be answered)--""God help me!""  Moments later, I got up, logged onto the computer, did a search for Orthodox Christian Churches, and found the faith that literally saved my life.  Three days ago, I was baptized, and my life has truly changed over the past year.

The nosebleed seats... are pretty nosebleed, but the closer seats are pretty nice. The concessions are pretty standard, with a few San Diego favorites. My favorite food is the garlic fries from Gordon Biersch. one nice aspect is that around the park's main walkways there are HD tvs showing the game while you're standing in line to get food, etc.

i think it's nicer than Qualcomm stadium was for baseball. However, i'm still upset at some of the political manuevering that occured to get it built, using public tax money.

You say, what?","I assume that places that allow dogs will be populated mostly if not entirely by dog owners.  Hey I say go for it.  I am sure that there are other places where dogs will not be allowed, probably at the digression of the owner.  In my case it is Love me Love my DOG, and he has better manners than most adults, and definitely better than any child I have recently seen.  I would love a place where I could go and take my dog and eat.  Dogs are very social creatures and need to be around others.  I hate seeing any dog chained up.  That is worse than prison for the dog.  I would like to see their owners treated the same way as they treat their animals.  Personally my dog is cleaner than most kids, and is welcome by anyone that I know.  A bad behaved dog does not have to be tolerated, and should be removed from the restaurant or any other place, ( and the owner should receive the brunt of it as it is his fault for failing to teach his animal.","2","1","1","1","1","3","2","3","3","3"

It's drier in the summer, but stays dry into late autumn. The winter is dull and sometimes wet and windy, though nothing like in the US. April is a month of change, so it can pour it down and sunshine during the same day. From September the weather grows steadily worse (wetter and colder) up until March. It's dull, overcast, cold/cool during the winter, although really our winters can be either wet and mild, as they have been recently apart from a few weeks of this past winter, or they can be colder and drier. (Think -10C minimum to +8C maximum approx) Summer can get up to +32C to +35C, but may equally well be +24C. Depending on where you are in the country the rainfall can vary dramatically. Some parts of the country are much drier than others. Some parts are much greener than others. The summer is typically short.","2","2","1","1","3","3","1","3","2","3"

"text188AH","Why does the color purple signify royalty?","Where does that originate from?","I believe most royal colours were garnered from nature's flowers. But it seems those that were of the deepest hue or most vibrant held a special place. There are not many vibrant purple flowers. They also don't just grow anywhere and most likely had to be cultivated in green houses which obviously would be connected to the royal family. Colours like red were also considered royal. The deeper and more vibrant the more likely a royal family would use them as their emblem and would incorporate the colour into their clothing and servants uniforms etc. The same goes for purple. I also think that purple, because of it's rarity became thought of as a godly colour and therefore it followed that only those who were appointed by god were permitted to adorn themselves with it. Most royalty was seen as chosen by god.","3","2","1","2","3","2","2","2","1","2"

I realize that in the late 90s, we had a Democrat in office(but he had a Republican congress to temper him, not to mention that the economy was supported by an unsustainable stock market bubble)<br/>Minimum wage- pretty ineffectual, but if anything it leads to slightly higher unemployment(all else equal). But it makes workers think that Democrats care for the working man.<br/>Exec. pay caps-LMFAO. So you tell me how much these execs should be paid. Also include how much Michael Jordan should be paid.<br/>Tax hikes on oil companies-Yes they had record profits, but consider when the price of oil is down. Should they assume all risks in the bad times but share the wealth in the good?","They will try and say the economy is already sinking like a rock and that is why they won the election, just like Clinton tried to prevent 9/11. The election sweep was because of Bush's refusal to deal with illegal immigration, and of course all the whining about every soldier who was killed being counted nightly on the evening news. I'm not discounting their sacrifice but it only encourages the enemy to kill more, and if they gave the same media attention to the people killed here at home by drunk driving EVERY DAY, would it keep the Kennedy clan sober behind the wheel? Back to your question, no one has ever taxed and spent their way to a better economy, it's just a short term gain. Look at how the myth of FDR's ""New Deal"" has taken hold, people think those programs pulled the country out of the ""Great Depression"", but all it did was boost morale a little. The developing world war and demand for raw materials and armanents is what slowly picked up the U.S economy by late 1936, if you go back and examine contemporary economic data and financial journals. But democrats control the history textbooks, and much of what is taught today is irrelevant crap and it's easy to see how the younger generation is disillusioned with a country whose heritage they learn little about, just the ""pc"" stuff. That is why we are doomed to repeat past mistakes, and after democrats really foul things up, there will be another ""1994"" and maybe this time the republicans will get ""term limits"" into law, so they won't get too complacent and voted out enmasse?

Personality is simply our focal point in space, but we are the space (spirit) in ourself and as a whole--a nonliteral perspective. Even if we were to put our physical body aside and not think of ourself there will still be that intelligence which is. Such intelligence can never die or end. Only the image or concept of life has beginning and ending and so death appears real to the personality, who is living the image. But see (live) through the personality and our center of awareness is the nonpersonality (everywhere and nowhere), the nonliteral perspective (God).

"text842T","what is the best and cheapest buffet in Las Vegas?","I'm heading to Vegas next week and I'm curious where I'm going to be able to get a great meal without dropping a fortune. I'm staying downtown, maybe there's something down there?","Most of the hotels and buffets downtown on Freement St and near there are much cheaper than on the strip.  When you get there look for one of the Vegas attractions booklets, like ""What's On"".  Its free and usually there will be one placed in your hotel room, or look in any hotel lobby or the car rental places.  There are 3 or 4 different guide booklets like this and they all list the shows, restaurants and tours and attractions.  The booklets also list the buffets by hotel and some list the current prices of the buffets.  (Prices have increased quite a bit in the past 5 years and are still going up)

If you are looking for a lower price on Freemont try Fitzgeralds. On the Strip we always (lately) go to the Imperial Palace.  Good buffet and a somewhat lower price than many.  If you like ribs, go to Tony Romas, its in one of the hotels on Freemont.  I have a review of it on my 360 page.","2","2","2","2","2","3","3","3","2","3"

Summer is a peak time to get married--so if you have a luxurious wedding in mind, I'd wait until next summer. If you still really want to get married this summer, then try and not be picky about what you want. Chances are you will be doing some slim pickins when it comes to florists, music, location, catering services. If you live in a big city, you'll probably have an even harder time try to locate things, as they'll probably mostly be booked.

"text701FR","Suggest me some BIG enough hints to my crush?","my question couldn't be read so reposting third time!

Okay here's the story: I'm in love with my best guy friend who's always been there for me. I like him really much and I do think he likes me too. But he's the type of shy guy who don't usually reveal his feelings to a girl he likes, and he needs BIG enough hints to push him to that. He needs to be encouraged!

So what are the BIG enough hints to encourage him to make the move?

Some facts: We like pinching and tickling each other, we spend hours together almost everyday, and we're close enough to share our thoughts and fears. I do realise he likes coming close to me when he talks and of course I like it. I don't talk about guys anymore to him (Duh, cuz i'm only interested in him).

Oh, and i'm not the type of girl who'd make the first move on a guy so don't suggest me asking him out. And also, remember that we're already good friends and if it were to be a hint, it has to be a BIG one that's more than just ""friendly""","Have you ever seen the McDonald's commercial where the girl is trying to explain the laws of attraction to a guy that was clearly her friend?  Be mindful that he may be a little green to what you are doing so be a little persist. in a casual conversation just describe the type of guy you'd like to have. Explaining this guy would have to know that he would have to approach you in a particular way (so he knows he has to ask you). Then lay it on thick as he sits there with his blue shirt or whatever on whatever day saying; I can picture it now this man in a blue shirt on a day like today would tell me how attractive I am looking me in my eyes asking me if I wouldn't mind being his girl. Then ask him does that sound silly or what? If describing him letting him know the day and everything doesn't get him to holla; hit'em with a bat and drag him home. ha","1","1","1","1","3","1","2","2","1","1"

Alpharooms charged me 50% as a cancellation fee.... this is worse than unfair bank fees!!","If you use an agency they have to recover some of their losses. I used a reputable agency but I lost the lot when cancelling. If you can book hotels direct except those in other countries unless you are sure of their policy. I self book as I contact the hotel direct. The hotel will nearly always offer you a better rate than going through a hotel booking agency. I only book direct with the hotel abroad when I am sure that I know all there is to know about their T's & C's. If you don't read them as appears to be your case, then you can only blame yourself, harsh I know but T's & C's are there for a reason. If you don't read them it really is your fault.

Culture is made of of all the things that a society has that make life possible. These include every day things and special things. For example, transportation, politics, business, recreation, communications, aesthetics (what is beautiful), protection, education, and spiritualization are all parts of culture. Religions are a part of spiritualization, which is societies ideas about how to explain the unknown or unknowable. Sometimes this explanation is very well organized and can be called a religion. Sometimes it is just stories or myths that are handed down by the tribal elders. All societies have spiritualization. Not all societies have religions.","1","3","2","2","3","2","2","3","2","3"

As a young man studying medicine, Guevara traveled ""rough"" throughout Latin America, bringing him into direct contact with the poverty in which many people lived. Through these experiences he became convinced that only revolution could remedy the region's economic inequality, leading him to study Marxism and become involved in Guatemala's social revolution under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.

Sometime later, Guevara became a member of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that seized power in Cuba in 1959. After serving in various important posts in the new government and writing a number of articles and books on the theory and practice of guerrilla warfare, Guevara left Cuba in 1965 with the intention of fomenting revolutions first in the Congo-Kinshasa (later named the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and then in Bolivia, where he was captured in a CIA-organized military operation. Guevara died at the hands of the Bolivian Army in La Higuera near Vallegrande on October 9, 1967. Participants in and witnesses to the events of his final hours testify that his captors summarily executed him, perhaps to avoid a public trial followed by imprisonment in Bolivia.","3","3","3","3","3","2","1","3","2","2"

Paganism can be traced back to Neolithic times and survived up until the middle ages when Christianity became powerful enough to erase it from existence. Paganism is an earth based religion which lays emphasis on the worship of all aspects of nature. Paganism appeared very early on in the history of the world. Examples of early paganism, can be seen in ancient Greek and Roman religions, as well as in ancient  Goddess worship and Druidic religions.

Ancient people believed that everything had a spirit and were polytheistic and they placed great importance on the worship of many Gods, Goddesses and Deities. Gods were a part of everyday life and great emphasis was placed on placating them through worship and ritual. Pagans believed that the Gods were immanent and entered every aspect of their society, influencing everything from laws and customs to the general workings of their community.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

My 300 thousand dollar house here would cost between 800 thousand to 1 million dollars up there depending on the exact location.

My suggestion to you would be to stay in the south!  The reason that prices are raising here is that the baby boomers are starting to get to the age of retirement and they are selling there million dollar plus homes up there and buying something bigger down here for about 2/3 less the price...

By June, the Going-to-the-Sun road should be open all the way through the park and the waterfalls will be in full-flow from snow-melt.  In addition, all of the concession services (i.e. shuttles, tour-buses, boat tours, etc.) should be running.

Is it worth going from Texas?  That depends on what you are looking for.  It is dramatically different from Texas with huge, sharp mountain peaks, sparkling glaciers, icy blue lakes and thundering waterfalls.  If none of those sound interesting, you should probably skip Glacier NP.","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","2","3"

I didn't have to be convinced of it .  Later, when I was 19, something terrible happened in me.  I couldn't overcome it.  I began actively seeking help in the church.  I eventually came to realize that I didn't have the faith that the people around me had.  I could see a love in them that I 'd never experienced.  They loved me as they tried to help me with my problem.  That love was the first thing I saw of God.  When I was 25, I understood that I wasn't really saved.  At that point I began to pursue Jesus for Him.  Not to get help, but just to know Him.  He set me free from that huge problem in my life, and He taught me how to fight it if it ever popped up again.  My entire life is changed because of Him.  I can't not believe.  The things that have happened in my life cannot be coincidence or chance.  I had my life radically changed by none other than Jesus Christ.  I just know that I know that I know.","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","3","2"

Seeing people in their underwear usually makes people more nervous (No offense to the person who put up that comment)

When you're up there, just do it like you're talking to your friends.  Yeah, its hard at first, I know, I'm on the speech team.  I'm going to guess that you're in high school, so I don't reccomend looking at the back walls, but pick about 3 or 4 people to be your focal points.  Look at them, and make sure that they're spread out around the room, so that you look like you're looking at everybody, where really, you're only looking at one.  I always found this very helpful.  Also, if you're allowed to walk around the classroom, then do it!  This helps relieve alot of stress, and calms you down.  If you stumble over words, dont get nervous, we all do that, and besides, you should try to use your nervous energy to make the performance more effective.  It is hard to do that, I had to act out a humor piece for my speech team, and its REALLY hard to keep a strait face.  The only way that you will get over your fear of public speaking is practice.

You may try saying you will refuse to testify if they don't protect you (you could get in trouble if you don't show up, but maybe they'll see you are serious and protect you.) You can also try writing a letter to the Judge and ask if you can testify anonymously and have your name and address kept private. If he/she doesn't do anything, then get your OWN attorney to file a petition to protect your identity. If none of that works and they ask your name/address while you are testifying, ask the Judge if you can keep that private, or say you refuse to answer for your own safety. You may be able to say you are just there to tell what you witnessed, and not give out personal information that has nothing to do with the crime.

Sometimes witnesses can give depositions, and then they are read in court instead of the witness going in person. Or they can videotape your testimony while you are disguised, and show the tape in the courtroom.","3","1","3","3","3","3","1","2","3","3"

How would a liberal try to fix the problem so that poor black kid can go to college and become a Lawyer?  A liberal will say the answer to solve this problem is throw money at it.  The conservative answer to this question is there are schools, there are loans, there are mass transit, all these are available now, so if you still can't make it, blame yourself.  A Chinese from the rural isolation of the countryside comes to the USA without any english, he takes advantage of the current schools, loans, and learn how to speak english, he is a lawyer, so sympathy for the american, no, I don't think so, being lazy has its own punishments, do it to yourself, don't blame government not helping losers.","I'm a liberal, and as a liberal I can appreciate that money does not solve everything, but telling people that need help to just figure out themselves solves nothing.  Honestly, that poor black kid has no chance in college because the conservatives think it is OK that public education is unjustly unequal.  Even if he got into college and got the loans, he would probably flunk out because he does not have the prior knowledge to compete.  If he did manage to finish even his first year, he would have worked a lot harder than everyone else, meaning less time for a job to pay for school, and a greater sacrifice than many others would be willing to give.  Liberals cannot give a poor kid the determination or the hard-work to make his dream a reality, but if the only think standing in his way is money, the government should give him some.

I do not blame you for using the example of a black kid.  It just points to another problem: conservatives are still unwilling to admit that a greater majority of those that are impoverished are minorities, and the educational system they are being provided is not helping them get ahead.  I do blame you for calling the black kid a loser though.

Democrats could not do any worse. That being said, I dont really think that either party has the American Citizen's best interest at heart.

Although we don't get snow here, we do have beautiful beaches and nice weather. Best places to visit, Sydney, Canberra, Cairns, and the Gold Coast. If you ever get over here you must visit Australia Zoo, on the Sunshine Coast, here you can have one on one experience with Kangaroos, as wild ones arent as curious.

He never settled in the Americas. The Mayflower passengers weren't illegal immigrants, because they were British citizens who traveled to Massachusetts, which was then a British colony.

Do you agree that when you look within yourself you do not observe a “self” in addition to the perceptions and feelings that you observe within yourself?

If you agree that you do not observe your “self” in this way, should you conclude (with Hume) that you do not have an underlying ‘personal identity’ but that you are simply the “stream” of perceptions and feelings that you observe within yourself?","I like with Hume's observations, and those of Owen Flanagan's, or William James' who understood us as a ""stream"" of thoughts, feelings...  However, it brings some theoretical troubles, but it is closer to our everyday's experiences of ourselves. The identity is not something given to us with our birth, but rather something that we construct and create during our life. Otherwise, we would never be capable for progress, changes, differences, nor to understand other people and their different moods, thoughts, attitudes... It is a large theoretical question in today's philosophical debates. Try to look inside your self and when you think you see it, try to describe it. Can you do it in one word, or you need to tell a whole story about what you feel, think, see... in this very moment.","2","1","1","1","2","3","2","3","1","2"

But I think your approach is not entirely right. As a male I do know the situation you have explained as i have on occasions placed my family in such situations. I feel you need to approach your fiancee a bit less bluntly and re-inform him of your concerns, try not to over react,  wait for his response. And then continue from there. At no time should you lay it all on him at once (meaning your anguish and emotions and ultimatums. I am sure this will have a detrimental effect). And with you somewhat chipping away at him about the problem (over time) he will eventually see his error in what is happening, and I am sure you will both get through this difficult period. Ultimately you need to always have it in the back of your mind that this matter is just a hurdle along your path to your lives as a happy family. With stating all this you need to think, (and converse with close Friends/family) weather or not the possibility of there actually being an underlying problem? If so that will need to be ascertained and addressed during this time. In other words you need to think about all of this from both sides, he won't he's a male (just like me).

 i need suggestions on:<br/>1. how to ACT when at the dinner-table, <br/>2. how to manage ""invisible"" props, what items of food to choose, what drinks, <br/>3. and little details to avoid  that might throw people in the audience off. 

Thanks! :]","If the point is to allow the audience to know what you are eating, then eating something distinctive would be a good idea. For example, you could use invisible chopsticks instead of a fork and spoon for chinese food or eat fried chicken with your fingers. (finger lickin' good)  Same with drinks, try  to think of something that will look different.  Is the drink hot? You would blow on it before drinking it.  Maybe pick a marshmallow off the top?

I think that the key is to start noticing what people look like while they eat.  Try eating in front of a mirror to see what you look like might be helpful also.  Sounds like a fun assignment! Enjoy! :)","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"

How somebody acts is a good indicator of how they will act, and so if they have a history of cheating, they will probably do it again in the future.  I'm not opposed to genuine characterial changes, but they are not easy, especially in the absence of religion.  Not all men cheat.  It is a matter of finding someone that still believes in fidelity and monogamy.  There is an old belief that I think carries some truth to it on a whole: If you want to know how a man will treat you, look at how he treats his mother.  Every man is going to cheat on you if he considers you a mere object - everything then boils down to going down to the grocery store and picking out some new meat to devour.  It is important to find a man who understand that you too are a human being with thoughts and feelings and beliefs.  Someone like this, in conjunction with taking his religion seriously, greatly diminishes the probability of cheating to near zero.","1","2","2","1","2","3","2","3","3","3"

"text1211AH","Asian values?","Is Japan’s claim that “Asian values” are responsible for its economic success a valid one?","Well, I guess you can say that it's at least partially true when applied to modern China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.  For the most part, Asians are more receptive to authority and domineering authority at that.  Asians traditionally place great value on family unity and perhaps even greater emphasis on education.

That's probably the biggest difference between us in the West versus the East--math and science education.  While engineering students balloon in numbers in Asia, they stagnate here in the US.  While our universities are top-notch, our students don't get the math/science drenching from childhood to adulthood they get in Asia.  Culturally, we emphasize liberal arts education instead, which increases our business acumen but sacrifices engineering prowess.  Considering the industries of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, I'd say the Asian emphasis on math and science has a great deal to do with their economic success.","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"

What would be a better outcome?","Poverty, I would help people get better health insurance and better paying jobs. For the poor sick people and orphans I would make the churches have to do what they were meant to do. They would no longer be building unnecessary rooms and gymnasiums (leave that for the schools), on to the church but they would be helping the sick and homeless people. If the churches wanted to be tax exempt they would have to prove they were a charity and doing their part to help society. This way society wouldn't have all of the burden. The better outcome would be more poor people in church and less evil on the streets.","1","3","2","2","3","1","3","2","2","2"

There's shopping within a few miles and a boat/ferry that goes back and forth to Cozumel several times a day.  I don't remember what the ferry costs.  Check out the websites for Playa del Carmen.  I've never been to Cancun, but friends have told me they enjoy going there.  I think your 21 yr old son would enjoy Cancun more probably because it would have more night life.

The Turks and Caicos would be your best bet. The beaches are pristine and the two times I've been there, you could literally be one of about 4 people on some of the beaches.

It's best to pick an up-beat song from a musical, and choose a part that shows off your range. Mark the start and stop points clearly for the pianist. Then, they'll often have you learn a short dance sequence. If you get called back, you'll usually have to do a cold reading from the script.

Sometimes it is better to talk with him about subjects that are familiar to him, like his favorite TV show, or book.

Have you heard of ""irreducible complexity""?  That was a premise Darwin himself put forth that said that if some system would not work at all if you removed only one part, then evolution is a fallacy.  There are numerous examples that scientists have found.  By scientists, I mean research scientists with far more education that you or I.  Look inside the living cell.  There are countless systems that would simply break down upon removing only one part.  The problem in Darwin's day was that people (including Darwin) thought that the cell was a blob of plasm with a slightly darker center.  I suggest you seriously look into it.  Regarding Creationism specifically, the number one piece of evidence in favor is information.  DNA contains so much information in such highly organized fashion that top statisticians say that pure chance could not account for it even in the billions of years since the earth cooled.  I would suggest rather than saying that there is no evidence for creation, look into it.  There IS evidence. Examine it.  Forget about the religious faith for now.  Just look into the pure science.

In my opinion it sounds like all they want is an easy way in.  We all have to work hard to be good citizens.  Why should they get an easy way?","My answer to this is simple.  Yes, our country is overpopulated and yes, immigrants should not receive our benefits if they're illegal.  THe pronlem is this: Our country was created to give immigrants seeking a better life a place to go.  At one point, almost ALL of us were immigrants.  I have mexican friends who's parents brought them here because the homes they have in Mexico are dirt floored, and there are NO jobs.  It's not that they don't want to work in Mexico, it's that there is NO work in Mexico.  Our government has made the process to become a legal citizen so tough (and expensive, time consuming, etc.) that most illegal immigrants can't afford the cost of becoming an American citizen, much less the time involved.  I feel that if they need a place to live or work, that's what America was created for.

China and Korea have a real attitude regarding Japan, mainly because of atrocities incurred by Japan on these two countries,in the days leading up to WWII and after.  China and Korea both want Japan to admit its wrong doings against these two countries and Japan is being very conservative on what it is and is not prepared to acknowledge regarding the events that happened over sixty years ago. This impasse has put a great strain on the relationship of both Koreas and China regarding Japan.

That is, we identify ourselves with our mind. Try to sit and think of nothing for more than 30 seconds, or just focus on your breath. Pretty soon your thoughts will start to wander, you'll start thinking about what you did yesterday, about if you turned off the stove, about when you can stop trying to think about nothing. It's the ultimate addiction. The killer thing about it is that we are not our minds; we identify ourselves -- we're addicted to -- something that is not even real, something that is constructed.

As for gothic culture, being goth has nothing to do with what clothes you wear or music you listen to, it is a way of thinking and seeing the world. The clothes that goths wear and the music that goths listen to is just a reflection of that mindset. Goths see that there is extreme pain and evil in the world, along with the good. Instead of condemning it or ignoring it, goths accept these things as a part of life and try and enjoy the good along with the bad, since they can't stop the bad from happening. They are not obsessed with death, they just accept it as an inevitability. They do not try and cause more pain in their (or anybody else's) lives, since there is plenty to start with.

No! I don't understand Kerry's remarks. If they were a mistake, then they were a mistake that should never have been made by a man in his position or who was afforded the level of education he received. I have no respect for Kerry on the matter of his ""botched joke.""

On the contrary, I have far more respect for a person who recognizes that, for whatever reason, their circumstances and or their abilities (financial or otherwise) are not going to afford them the level of success through our education system that was afforded by the likes of Kerry.

It takes a lot of COURAGE and WISDOM to realize that joining the military and laying your life on the line for your country might very well be the only way you have a chance in this world. 

So there are enlisted who change oil, clean tires and chip paint. There are enlisted who flip eggs and scrub pots and pans. There are amo runners and hole diggers.","I really do believe Kerry was attempting to say Bush was the one that didn't make the most of his education, not enlisted men.  However, he sure blew the delivery, and soldiers have a right to be mad at him.

I do have respect for enlisted personnel -- they get the worst jobs in the military, are most often the ones putting their lives on the line, and do it all as a volunteer for very little pay.  That said, *SOME* enlisted personnel don't do it for patriotism or altruistic reasons, they do it because they don't see any other choice.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's great that there IS an opportunity for them to better themselves in the military, learn skills that can translate into jobs after they're out, and get paid to do it.  I just wish so many of them didn't have to die in order to have that opportunity -- wouldn't it be better if there were *other* opportunities for them to get the same skills and make some money that didn't involved risking their lives?

This goes for the old testament too because a lot of the evidence that Jesus was the Messiah comes from the prophesies in the old testament.","2","3","2","3","3","1","2","3","2","2"

We are all precious in the sight of God. So are our lives as precious jewels in God's coffers. After all He has paid the ultimate ransom for each one of us. Every person from the first moment of conception is worth more than all the gold in the world  to God. Unfortunately some people don't value human life the same as God does and they selfishly kill their unborn children. Some even rape and destroy young women and even children. And some people would rather see an old person euthanized than to have the burden of taking care of them. How sad that our parents and older relatives took care of us and provided for us when we needed it and now some people think they are now worthless because they are sick and need assisted living. You have a value beyond human comprehension. Respect life in all stages and God will bless you with happiness.","2","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","1","1"

My opinion will remain nutral for now, I will post it later.","I think it's fine. Bear in mind most of these holidays are supposed to be just that Holidays. Private businesses however to maximize profits have decreased the number of observed holidays making them mandatory work days to increase their bottom lines at the expense of the employee. Look at European countries many have vacation time equalling up to 6 weeks or more a year and 30 hour work weeks. They have happier and more productive employees. I think there are many benefits to working in a Government position and the ""extra"" days off are just one of them. I hate to use the term ""extra days off"" cause in reality all companies should follow the US Gov with respect to observed days off thus making those ""extra"" days off just normally observed normal days off.","2","3","2","3","3","3","2","2","1","2"

Some abilities are better than others and it even appears to me that some people are totally devoid of any abilities (whether naturally so or due to environment is unimportant). We must structure society so that we reward those that have more to offer while protecting those that don't from abuse and being taken advantage of by others.

This is something she is just going to have to learn to deal with eventually,  because caring about someone does involve pain sometimes (its sad but true!).

In an ideal society, where everyone is eductaed, and not marginalized, the pay structure would take care of redistribution of wealth, such that executives would not be able to demand exorbitant salaries, and workers would not be paid less than required, simply becuase information would flow freely.

"text1799SC","Why do Christians expect people of ""no faith"" to be open minded when they tend to be the ones who are closed.","My wife recently became a ""Christian"" (now going on 4 years). As a result of this, I have been thrust into the world of God & Jesus and the fantastic stories of the bible. All our friends and neighbors are devout Christians as well and I seem to be the odd man out. Having said this, I am regularly given books, magazines, articles and lectures about why I should be become a Christian and to give my heart to Jesus. I am an unashamed Atheist, but I consider myself an open minded person and have read everything I am given to explore both sides of the debate. However, whenever I try to get a Christian to read my ""non-Christian"" material or to explore other creation possibilities, they scoff at me. This doesn't just happen with one person or even two...every Christian I have offered material to flatly declines. It's funny that if you are NOT a Christian, you are required/expected to be open minded, but if you ARE a Christian this doesn't seem to apply to you. What gives?","It seems the Christians you know aren't playing fair, but look at it from their point of view. Before they became Christians they probably knew the same stuff you know, believed the same theories of evolution, read or heard lots of things about other faiths. It's impossible to miss all of that. Then they met Jesus (bear with that, even if you don't believe in Him) and found the ultimate truth. If you found the cure for cancer would you keep looking for another cure? If you won the lottery would you keep playing? When people find the truth, they stop searching. Maybe they could read your books to humour you but it wouldn't be real to them. I sympathise with how you feel. If Jesus ever becomes real to you, remember how you feel now and try not to do it to others.","2","3","3","3","3","3","1","1","1","1"

Ok, I know that I am probably going to get slammed here, but I have an explanation, here it is:  Women who have abortions who try to have a baby later on, typically find it very hard to carry the baby.  And women that have had more than one abortion, most likely will NEVER be able to carry a baby.  I am not saying ALL, there are people I am sure that has successfully had kids after an abortion.

I'm just wondering, when commercial airlines fly to various cities around Australia (say for example, I'm from Cairns, and I fly to Melbourne), would they go along the coast or cut through the land? and how about Brisbane? I'm guessing they fly along the coast?

Best answer will be rewarded.","Aviation traffic fly along the routes that are outlined by the countries aviation authority.  Routes are not decided on by airlines.  So, depending on where an airliner is going, it will be designated a specific route based on information from the aviation authority and then variations are given by air traffic control and are also based on weather, other traffic, and the type of aircraft.  So, a flight may be routed along the coast or over water or both.. depending on the above criteria.

If a recipient has a job, any job and is making even a meager wage, then assistance should be provided to bring them up to an acceptable standard of living.

And this is NOT a homework question I'm trying to leech out of you guys.","Okay, here's a 100% true story that was told to me when I was much younger. In 1944 at Stalag Luft III, a German POW Camp, a group of prisoners tried to escape. I was told this story by a man with whom I go to church who flew with the RAF bombers and was shot down over Nazi Germany. While in the POW camp the men were fed what was called ""German Black Bread"" which was bread made with flour AND sawdust (because sawdust is a lot cheaper than flour!). When I asked him how he could eat that he simply responded ""you've never been hungry, have you?"". The men dug three tunnels underneath one of their barracks, working for many days and nights with Nazi guards close by. They named the tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry. On the night of the ""escape"" they drew straws to see who would get to go (there were a lot of men!), but the man who told me the story didn't get to go. It was probably for the better, though, as only three men escaped and of those only one made it safely back to Britain. The event was adapted into a book and later a great movie starring Steve McQueen! Check it out.","2","2","2","2","3","3","1","2","1","2"

The arguments tend to be around group cohesion ie lots of guys fighting for their friends, as well as issues around relationships and hygiene particularly once a month. There is the question of fitness and strength though there is no reason a woman who is able to pass the fitness and strength element to the same standard as the men (unlike the rest of the UK armed forces where the requirement is lower for women) shouldn’t get in. And of course aggression, of all the corps etc of the armed forces the infantry and Special Forces etc must have aggression and as a rule (there are of course acceptations) men are more aggressive than women.

When blood is collected and stored for emergencies it is not coded by race, it is coded by type. It makes no difference what the donors heritage is, as long as the blood type is a match to the person who needs the transfusion.

You have to trust the people that taught you about life not to consume those types of things.  If you tried them and liked them, then you are teased.

Here's what I suggest instead.  When you get to ports find an internet cafe.  Sometimes they are located right on the dock.  We found them right near the dock in Grand Caymon, Costa Rica, Russia and a couple other places.  Generally you can get an hour of high speed for $2 or 3 dollars,  vs $100 on ship.  We usually go on tours in ports, but I always ask the tour guide if there are internet cafe's and where they are.  We found them in a 7/11 in one country and in a grocery store in another.

It is simply a style worked in loose strokes.  The idea is to give an ""impression"" of the subject.  Choose a simple subject, like a still life or bowl of fruit.  Then layout your palette using the colors you see (make sure to look for subtle colors only an artist might see...such as the ""blue"" in an apple), and with a larger than usual brush, stroke the basic shapes in a medium value, then add shadows, then a highlight layer.  That should do for a class project in Impressionism.  The danger would come from over-working the painting.  You don't want fine strokes or details, remember just the ""impression"" of your subject.

The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the Tridentine Council.""

The fact of the matter is, it WAS some time before the New Testament was put together as one.  What is not disputed, however, is that every book of the New Testament was widely accepted as being Divinely Inspired, and that no books outside of the New Testament were widely accepted as being Divinely Inspired.  A few of the books that we now have in our New Testament was debated by some.  No books outside of our New Testament were argued to be Scripture.  None of the books that were disputed were attacked for their authenticity, by the way, simply whether or not they were indeed ""inspired by God.""  This dispute was finally settled when they looked through other early church writings and discovered that the earliest mentions of these books all treated them as scripture.  So, every book of the New Testament was immediately recognized as scripture, but it was not until about the middle of the third century (not the 16th) that we find the collection of 27 books we find today.  It should also be reiterated that NO OTHER BOOKS were ever even considered.  The council of Trent, that you mention, is only when the Catholic church made those 27 books ""official,"" because someone realized that the Catholic church had never ""officially"" stated that these 27 books were the New Testament.","3","3","2","3","2","3","3","3","1","3"

It consists of Pulau Pinang (an island of 108 sq mi/280 sq km), formerly known as Georgetown; and Province Wellesley (292 sq mi/756 sq km), a strip of territory on the Malay Peninsula adjacent to Pulau Pinang. On the island is the capital, the city of Pinang, also known as Georgetown (1991 pop. 219,376); it is Malaysia's second-busiest port. It was founded in 1786 by British merchants and was ruled by Great Britain until it became part of what is now Malaysia in 1957. The island has large tin-smelting works, and large areas are devoted to rice and rubber. Well over half the inhabitants of the state are Chinese. Indians are less numerous; less than a third are Malays. Pinang Island was the first British settlement on the Malay Peninsula. It was occupied in 1786 by Francis Light of the British East India Company with the permission of the sultan of Kedah. After an unsuccessful attempt to retake the island (1791), the sultan agreed on a settlement from the British of an annual stipend, and in 1800 he also ceded Province Wellesley. Pinang, together with Province Wellesley, Malacca, and Singapore, became known as the Straits Settlements. Under the British, Pinang grew rapidly in commercial importance, although it was surpassed by Singapore. Pinang joined the Federation of Malaya (see Malaysia) in 1948.","3","3","2","3","3","3","1","2","3","3"

Also, what seems to be holding it up is the guest worker/amnesty discussion.

While this discussion continues, the border remains open.  Many have suggested that we at least pass a simple border security bill, not changing penalties or more rigidly criminalizing anyone, for now, and work the rest out at a pace that allows the hard questions to be looked at.  

Me, if I actually had border security would support legalization for screened illegals. However, my concern is total numbers. Schools in border states are already foundering, and I think the guest worker program to keep wages permenantly depressed, on top of amnesty, is too much. They are trying to hard to give everyone everything without stopping to evaluate impact.

Would you support border security first, then figure out the rest?","Yes, absolutely!  Seal up the borders leakproof tight - then deal with the illegals already in the country.  I don't think amnesty is the answer, no matter what, though, as no matter how you look at it, that is rewarding them for breaking the law and coming in illegally and that will only still tell others to do whatever they have to do to come on in as if you wait long enough there will be ""the reward.""

I think it's really important to remember that the bible was written by man, and no matter how you look at it, stories become skewed over time. So, another question might be: was it really God that said you should not do these things, or were they simply tabu things that the church wished to discourage at the time.  God also gave us the freedom to choose, and in the long run, he/she is the judge that matters. You should live your life by the feeling in your heart.

If so why all the art and movies against your words?","Joeseph Smiths first vision, he was 14 years old, all art would indicate he is in his late 20s or early 30s. In the Restoration why is Joseph Smith and his scrib sitting at a table veiwing the plates when no one else was to see. Why does he wear a ring on his right hand. Why was he killed fleeing for his life. Not much of a mayrter. If the faith is true why mislead with art.","In my opinion, Mormons aren't any different from any other religion. I have done a little studying of religions throughout history, and have noticed the evolution throughout the years.  Originallly, humans worshipped many nature gods. this is called polytheism, the Jewish people were the first (i believe) to worship a single god (monotheism)but they started out as a polytheistic people. In my opinion (not fact) I believe that religion was originally created as a  means for man to understand his world, and it has branched into many different religions and beliefs. In the modern sense of the word and idea, when you think of it, all religions began as cults. Are they wrong? Not necessarily. But most people don't accept that possiblity. All religions require faith, because there

is no way to prove or disprove their beliefs. I don't judge any one based on their religious beliefs, because I don't know why they believe what they believe, and from a personal standpoint i don't care. However as an observation in society, it's very interesting. Watch South Park episode 712 All abou Mormons, they give a wise and unique look at religion. Hilarious too.  Any way, artists create images of what they think is true. Most people are against mormons, therefore most artists don't like mormons.  Everyone has an agenda, even artists.","2","2","1","1","2","3","2","2","3","3"

You're right, there are a lot of complainers and whiners here in America, and they're too lazy to do the simple little things it takes to get involved and make changes.  But remember, this government is not for someone to ""take control over"" as you say.  Our ""one man, one vote"" methodology of running this republic has been the most effective method of people governing themselves in world history, and our division of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of our government, replicated in each and every State in this union was developed as a way to prevent any one person or small group of persons from taking control over us.

A funeral is very expensive and can be excessive for the family...  If you want to give them money wait a little while before doing it. maybe a couple days to let the initial shock of the death settle. At the funeral is the appropraite time for such things.

Think of it this way.  Any logical conclusion must be developed from ""known"" prerequisites.  Those prerequisites are, in turn, the logical conclusions of ""known"" statements that came before.  Traced back far enough, however, this process will break down and leave us only with faith that what we base our conclusions on is ""known"".

For example, I can perceive this keyboard with my senses and logically conclude that it is there but that logical conclusion is based on the assumption that my senses are a reliable source for gathering knowledge.  This is something that I cannot logically prove.  Thus I am left with two options.  I can either a) conclude that absolutely nothing can ever be know or b) have faith that what I perceive is real.","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","3","3"

You need to learn about a little thing called HUMILITY.  Humility is the opposite of PRIDE.  Those who are PROUD invite trouble to heap itself upon them.  Ever hear the saying ""Pride cometh before a fall""?  It's absolutely true.  Even the Christian Bible says, ""He who humbles himself shall be exalted, and he who exalts himself shall be humbled"".  Learn the simple fact that your beauty and nicety don't mean shit unless you STOP thinking about yourself completely and start serving your fellow man with a grateful heart.  Do that, and you will find personal fulfillment, a perfect mate, and what the Bible calls ""The Kingdom of Heaven.""  To put it in a more secular way; just remember what the Wizard of Oz himself said to the Tin Man......""And remember my sentimental friend:  A heart is not measured by how much  you love, but by how much you are loved by others.""  Get over yourself, and any curse laid upon you (and most, if not all curses are self imposed, half of them via guilt) will wither and fade, like the Aramaic parchment of olde.....................","2","1","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"

6...Did the media have any role that may have influenced the verdict?

7...Did the system of justice come apart or did it prevail in the trial of OJ Simpson?

8...And, can you say the same influences that were there for OJ Simpson were there in the trial of Robert Blake?

9...Did the police plant any evidence and were the police at fault in collecting the evidence including the DNA evidence.

To think, the children are finally healing after going through so much and 'rippppp', there goes the bandage that will let the wounds flow.  The truth is, we all know that trial was a farse.  As soon as there was any notion of evidence tampering, the jury had no choice but to follow the lines of the law no matter how blurred they had become.

Taxes on just the 12 million is enough to ensure free health care for US citizens. My grandmother is an immigrant, she came here from Italy. She learned engish so why can't Mexicans learn english. Teachers and hospital workers shouldn't be forced to learn a new language. It is supposed to be one of the rules of becoming a citizen that you learn english. Loss of jobs is another Major issue, with American jobs being shipped over seas and even to Mexico, soon enough we will run out of high paying jobs especially in the manufacturing sector. Try having a house built in Denver, I bet most of the people doing the work are illegals. Mexican's do take jobs away from Americans.

Tell them that you are willing to compromise to the sacrifice it takes to be in a ""different"" school, that it is your dream and that you really need their support. Your parents love you and they want you to be happy, you have to let them know the way you feel. Also, do your research, find the schools near you, so you have everything ready for the time you talk to them. that will show them that your interest is authentic. If they do not look to convinced ask them to at least let you go to the auditions and see how they turn out in order to make a desicion. Do you have a teacher in shool that knows your work as an actress? if you feel you need a bit of help to bring this up to your parents you may want to have a teacher help you, specially if he/she recognices that you have true talent.

If you stay at a resort, you can take advantage of Disney's Magical Express, which is a service that transports you from the airport to the resort.  Once at the resort, there are Disney busses that take you to any of the parks, which eliminates the need for a rental car.

Once you get there, you will probably spend most of your time at the Magic Kingdom.  That's where most of the little kid stuff is.

He was over the limit and took to the station, he was not charged until the following day at 2.30pm.<br/>Some of our other friends are saying he should have been charged whilst drunk and read his rights etc. I think they must have let him sober up before charging him etc. Does anyone know what the procedure is?

Please note that I totally disagree with what he has done.","the police will sometimes not read a persons rights if they are excessively drunk-there is no point he wouldn't remember anyway-this is not to condone your freinds actions-that person should be told that while dui he could have killed himself or even worse someone else. once it has been ascertained that at the time he was over the limit the police can charge him when they think he has have sobered up enough to understand the charge and seek legal representation. a person can be arrested for an offence whilst drunk but they cannot be charged for that offence until sober. that police are correct in their actions.","3","2","2","3","3","2","3","2","1","2"

I can't find more polite words, please DO NOT be narrow-minded(No Offense) and thought that i want to re-open this case and such.","From what I understand, they were pictures of Muhammad with a bomb as a turban.  Even if it was just pictures of Muhammad, though, it would be offensive because Muslims are not supposed to make drawings or other depictions of Muhammad.  One reason for this is that no one could make an accurate depiction of Him and it would be insulting to try.

Christians don't seem to have any problem inaccurately depicting Christ, so it's kinda difficult to explain the significance, but basically just know that any picture drawn to represent Muhammad is an offense because its existence is like saying He's no different from the next guy.","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","3"

If you're under 21 and think you can answer this question, you're wrong.  So, please, only answers from adults who are serious and that have some moral principle to back up their position.","I can't think of a moral argument (other than those based on religion) which could definitively say that promiscuity (when you are single) is immoral.  If promiscuity is practiced safely and all partners know that the person has no intentions of settling down, I don't think it's possible to create a strong moral argument against it.  I determine the ethical nature of issues by deciding if the action will hurt other people, if the answer is yes it's immoral.  So, irresponsible promiscuous behavior is immoral, however responsible promiscuity is moral.

Some may try to argue that it's immoral because having more partners may increase the chances of spreading STDs.  However, this chance is also high in those who have unprotected sex with a relatively few amount of people.  If sex is consensual and safe, it should be considered moral.","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

You shouldn't say that just based on a fascinating history or the political theories because I agree that they sound good.  All that the Bolsheviks managed to start was a line of totalitarian rulers; it was not true Communism.

Is it because we are taught to think that something must be created, that my mind can't grasp the concept that everything has always been?

Or is it that nothing (what we call nothing) actually encompasses everything, i.e. 0 = everything

1 = 1 part of everything, etc.?

you get the idea?

Or as one answer said, maybe we are nothing too?

In the beginning there was nothing, and we are what exists as a result?

If you say something has always been, then how is that possible?

God prophecy unfolds itself:<br/> <br/>Qur’an Testify and unfolds prophecy of Bible! Through prophet Muhammad – Another Christ (Messiah) who teaches all the things to your remembrance and have testified Jesus as predicted by Jesus.

Holy Ghost was not “Another Comforter, to come, Teach and Testify”.  Holy Ghost was always there!<br/>Who else - Explain with facts.

Pls. No Jewish comments – Thanks.","No, no-you can't do that. You can not mix Scripture with the Koran. The New Testament Scriptures (Bible ) were written by people who actually knew the risen Christ, and saw Him alive. Mohammad did not. The Koran, how ever holy you may claim, is not Scriptures from God, and can never be. The last book of the Bible closes with a warning not to attempt to add to God's word. To equate Koran with God is a violation of Scripture.

Paracletus means-""one who comes along side"" (like a helper). He is given titles but no name. Yes: 'comforter, and holy ghost (spirit) , but no name.

That Jesus would say that no one had seen or heard God ant any time, while his followers both saw and heard him, is clear proof that Jesus was not God.

Perhaps the clearest indication we have that Jesus and God are not equal, and therefore not one and the same, come again from the mouth of Jesus himself who said in John 14:28, ""My Father is greater than I."" When someone referred to him as a ""good master"" in Luke 18:19, Jesus responded, ""Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God..."" Further more, Jesus drew clear distinctions between himself and God when he said, ""I proceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of myself but He sent me."" (John 8:42) Jesus gave clear evidence of his subordination to God, rather than his equality with God, when he said in Luke 22:42, ""not my will but thine be done,"" and in John 5:30, ""I seek not mine own will but the will of the Father which has sent me."" That Jesus would admit that he did not come into the world on his own initiative but was directed to do so, that he would acknowledge another being as greater than himself, and that he would negate his own will in deference to affirming the will of another, give clear proof that Jesus is not the Supreme One and therefore Jesus is not God.","i also have some points

God is the ultimate judge and refuge for all, and He does not call upon nor pray to any others. But Jesus acknowledged that there was one whom he worshipped and to whom he prayed when he said, ""I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God."" (John 20:17) He is also reported to have cried out while on the cross, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" (Matt 27:46) If Jesus were God, then couldn't this be read ""Myself, myself, why hast thou forsaken me?"" Would that not be pure nonsense? When Jesus prayed the Lord's prayer (Luke 11:2-4) was he praying to himself? When in the garden of Gethsemane he prayed, ""O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt. "" (Matt 26:36-39) Was Jesus praying to himself?

"text1837AH","Is rape ever justified? Is human society more important than individual rights?","Imagine if there were only 2 human beings left on the earth, a male and a female. One of the 2 doesn't want to have sex. Is it okay to rape?

This situation might seem stupid but if we add a few preconditions it becomes rather tough:

1) There are only 2 possible outcomes:

Outcome A: No rape and the 2 people die and mankind ends within their generation. There are no more human ever.

Outcome B: One rapes the other and within a limited amount of generations the earth returns to how it is now, meaning everything is exactly how it is now, we don't remember the rape, we have friends, family, and a population in the billions.

2) The 2 people know these are the 2 possible outcomes.

3) All other outcomes such as abortion, lack of development of family values, and high birth defects due to incest are ignored.

Which is more justified the rights of the individual to not be raped or importance of mankind as a whole?

Majority rule versus minority rights?

Rape versus life?","I do not think you have considered where our RIGHTS come from. The writers of the Declaration of Independence state that our rights come from God (read it). Rights do not come from the state, the state only protects an individual's rights. But an individual cannot pick and choose what rights they wish to have. That right has to be given by a higher authority (God). In this case the man need not rape the woman because God has already commanded on this issue. The real question is for the woman. Does she want to become this man's wife and bear children? To answer that question she must determine if marrying this man is God's will. The arguement could be made that it is the will of God since these are the last two people on earth and we are all still commanded to multiply. If she absolutely refuses to marry the man and have children, then it is an obvious sign that God has condemned the human race to extinction. A woman who was unwilling to fulfill God's commands even if slightly inconvenient to her is absolutely unfit to be a mother who would train up the next generation. Her rotten, selfish attitude would be caught by her kids.","2","1","1","1","3","2","2","2","2","2"

In Cape Town there are a lot of things to including Ratanga Junction, Shark diving, Cable car up Table Mountain, etc-these things all require a not so small amount of money (well peanuts if you have dollars), but let's say that if you really wanna get out and around and have a great time you will need about $600,00.

There's no difference. And this question is not meant to offend anyone.","Actually, Jews originated in the Middle East. Nowadays, I think most of the Jews you see today look white because they intermixed with other races so much. There are even Chinese Jews- ETHNIC Chinese Jews- in Tibet, and they look Chinese.

For some reason, a lot of people throughout history don't like Jews- the Roman Catholic Church (the one from the Middle Ages, not the Church today), most Arabic nations, Nazi Germany... the list goes on and on. So the distinction, I suppose, is because of their religion and way of life, and also because of certain physical features, like a prominent nose.","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

She is in a special unit where she is with other women that harmed children, so she is safe from the other inmates who would not like her very much.  She can wear her own clothes, wear make up, and basically just hang out and have fun all day. I remember seeing pictures of her, all smiles, with other inmates.  She has luxuries a lot of law-abiding people cannot afford.

If we do not take initiative and act proactively then we are most likely to follow random purposes all around us. In my view life is all about action and the weakest form of action is in thinking. But this weakest part becomes the strongest when we are able to establish a direct correlation between what we think and what we eventually do. This is an ability that sooner or later we all have to develop. The same purpose we have in mind when we chooses mottos in our life – to strengthen our thoughts by setting permanent standards in this other wise tricky areas of lour mind.

My motto in life, the one relating to yours, is ‘readiness is all’. For there is more reason in preparation than there is in elaborate planning. Planning is indispensable in normal life but it is useful when it is done as a part of preparation of our mind. There is nothing such as perfect planning, but readiness in mind enables us see what we look for.
