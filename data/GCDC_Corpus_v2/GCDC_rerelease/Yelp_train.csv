"FUYQ99EUHg2TOHMMTy7cFQ","Seasons Buffet","Most months this buffet at the Silverton has one day a week they do BOGO. For Jan it's BOGO Thursday. Sign up for a card at the player's club and the day of the BOGO print out a coupon at the kiosk and head to the buffet. The coupon is only good for that day.

Also the same day you sign up for the player's card, play table games and earn just 50 points and you get another coupon for a free buffet to use anytime you want.

The buffet is pretty good for $9.99, then factor in the BOGO it's only $5/person. Can't beat that deal, as you can't even get full of of $5 at a fast food place.  There's Mexican food (fish tacos, menudo, pozole, or albondigas soup, ground beef tacos), carving station (roast beef, chicken or turkey, and even their skin fried, ham, grilled veggies), Italian (pizza, pasta), Asian (Pad thai or chow mein, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, Asian soups, string beans), and salad bar. Even for a picky eater, you can make yourself a nice big healthy salad and it will be worth the $5.","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","2","1","2"
"8Mkhxopb8jzL748V-oCVKg","The Cleaning Authority - Phoenix","Awful, I should have looked at yelp.  I received a flyer in the mail and called to get information.  The new owner came over to give me an estimate and go through a folder with a complete description of what they do. I was thrilled and hired them  to clean every other week.  The first 2 cleanings they call their detailed cleanings and talk about over promise and under deliver.  The first 2 ""detailed cleanings"" were average and nothing what they tell you they would do.  The third normal cleaning was awful!  They missed everything and I really think my 4 year old could have cleaned better than they did.  You can tell they use a duster and just dust around things and not pick up small objects to dust under (lazy!)

On top of it, I had given them a key and on a visit they couldn't get the door unlocked and rather than call me, they had their manager Kim drive out with her screwdriver and take the whole lock off (which ended up breaking). They left after their cleaning with no door handle or lock which anyone could have gotten in, and they didn't even tell me the door handle was off.  They did comp the cleaning but I just don't feel like they used good judgment and had horrible communication.

We have security cameras installed and on 1 cleaning I could hear the 2 cleaners scoping out the cameras and telling each other where they were.  SHADY!!

Beware, they seem organized and the new owners seem nice but  I think whoever runs and hires these cleaners needs to replaced.  I definitely would not recommend them.","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"
"db7i0JVq9s_AKVvOoHBNxQ","Bad Owl Coffee","I don't know how I found this place on Yelp, but I'm so glad I did because I am a bigtime Harry Potter fan. I bookmarked it and insisted that my husband and I get our coffee here during our next visit. We found ourselves there on a Saturday morning around 9:30am and it wasn't too crowded.

I was overwhelmed by the sheer options of lattes and other warm beverages. Yelp was offering a 20% discount for checking in on iced lattes so I decided to do an iced latte to help me narrow down my choices, but it didn't help much. My husband ordered a hot coconut latte and he loved it!!! It's hard to impress this man with much but he thought his latte was excellent. We also shared the croissant breakfast sandwich and we both liked that as well.

I loved the subtle homage this place pays to Harry Potter. It's a cool place that both kids and adults can enjoy. I wish we had a place like this closer to where we live.","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"
"9HebYLRstsuqti5_7P0hEg","Moe's Southwest Grill","I love Moe's. So much better than Chipotle, IMO. I make the drive out here way more than I like to admit but it's just a great place to get a burrito. This place is different from the other chain burrito places in its array of options. Where Chipotle was going for a streamlined, simplistic menu, Moe's has come in with probably twice as many options. They have tofu, three kinds of grilled veggies (all cooked separately from animal-derived ingredients), rice, beans, guacamole, and a bunch of additional veggies to make the perfect creation.

They give a free order of chips with every order and they have a salsa bar with five or six different salsas at a time. Try the tomatillo, it's seriously the biggest reason I go to Moe's, it's that good. A lot of the other salsas are too sweet for me, but to each their own. Lastly, I rarely drink pop but they have a special Vanilla Peach drink on their Coke Freestyle machine.

I wouldn't reward Moe's with the title of best burrito, I think that belongs to either Ohio City Burrito or Taco Tonto's. But as far as the chain places, Moe's is tops.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3","3"
"7KgfshQrZ9O9iMIABtm59Q","Nirvana the Flavors of India","Visiting from the US, I was looking for a somewhat decent Indian dining experience for dinner in the Mississauga/Brampton area without walking to a hole in the wall place where you're served on a paper plate and given plastic utensils...and there are tons of those in the area.  It's difficult to scour for a nice place because there's tons of Indians in the area and Yelp reviews seem to dictate there's no satisfying them as they always have a gripe with a restaurant for one reason or another and there seems to be no sure bet go-to place for reliable food.  I dined at Nirvana last night and it fits the bill for a nice place where you can have dinner with friends or family.  None of the food overly impressed me, but there was nothing bad with it..I guess average is how everything can be described from the mango lassi to the naan to the main courses (ordered chicken and paneer dishes) to the dessert.  Why 4 stars instead of 3?  The decor is welcoming and seeing one of the chefs working at the tandoor oven behind a glass is a nice touch I haven't ever seen at another Indian dining establishment.  Lastly, the female servers who work there are adorably cute and always running around with smiles on their faces.  If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely be back here for a decent meal and friendly service.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","1","2","2"

I asked, and the waitress just kept repeating 'it's policy' 'it's policy' it's policy' like some automated drone. How about some autonomy and make an easy call to increase your daily sales?

The roadside signage is so nondescript that I drive past this place daily on my way to and from work and have never noticed it. The location itself, once you turn into the plaza, is hidden from the street because it is behind another building. Problematic, but alleviated with good advertising.

Went in and there was another solo chick leaving with her cup of dessert. Layout of store is a little odd: cups and toppings by door, then yogurt dispensers, followed by more toppings and the register, where you are finally addressed by an employee.

Opted to mixed a few flavors: the cookies and cream was on the bland side, but the Tahitian vanilla and dark chocolate were both very good. For toppings, I added strawberries (not many left), cherries, and a sprinkle of peanuts for crunch. Topping selection overall seems to be on the slim side, though I can't tell you what they were missing.

Service was polite. TVs inside were tuned to SportsCenter and the Spurs game. Now that this place is on my radar, it's the closest froyo to home. Will likely be stopping by on my way home from bad days at work.","2","1","3","2","2","2","3","2","2","2"

my major complaint about this place is that they overbook. it's gotten MUCH worse now. I had an appointment for 1:45pm (over my lunch break for work). it takes me 15 minutes to drive there so i had planned to be back at work on time with time to spare to buy lunch. i waited 25 MINUTES for my appointment, so i finally got in at 2:10. needless to say, i did not make it back to work on time and i had to get my lunch to go and wolf it down at my desk.

not only did i wait 25 minutes for my appointment, but the desk staff were very unapologetic about it. i told them that i was on my lunch and the lady told me ""our two technicians are working so it's beyond our control.""

Very good pastry; wifi that is uncommonly quick to connect and fast for a Montreal cafe; pleasant staff. Lots of stable, amply sized tables with schoolroom chairs.

Starting with the miniature bread - no flavor, lack of salt but he 4 side spoons of kosher salt, red pepper flakes, and pesto sauce was a nice touch. The Caesar salad was swimming in sweet lemon capers - I ordered dressing in the side but the lettuce was over powered by capers. Orzo meatballs were flavorless and had more orzo than meat. No salt or garlic flavor. Marqarita pizza had limited, mostly dough and no flavor-thankfully I used red pepper flakes  to rescue. The chicken cacciatore for two( served on one plate and had to ask for a second plate) was fried chicken ( oops - bakes and flash fried ) had no flavor and a small bowel of tomatoes and peppers. Nothing traditional . The broccolini was inedible since it was drenched in lemon - could not taste the vegetable. The veal shank - was another breaded /fried fish with no flavor.

"egvjp70Ww4g1QAhKP92bbQ","Green New American Vegetarian","As an on-again, off-again vegetarian, I really value culinary experiences that are so good, or so interesting, that I don't miss meat. Green doesn't quite meet (meat?) this standard: though they make some of the best meatless meat dishes in town, I still catch myself thinking, ""This would be even better if it was made of beef and bacon."" Their imitation beef and chicken are impressively like the real things, but that's the fundamental problem (in my humble opinion) with this style of vegetarian cuisine: no matter how good you make it, ""like the real thing"" is never gonna beat the real thing. Their veggie burgers are tasty, but burgers are tastier. Soynamis are pretty good, but milkshakes will always be better. I know that New American is their thing, but I think Green would be even better if they took a little more inspiration from traditions like Indian and Middle Eastern, which have done spectacular things without meat for thousands of years.

None of this, of course, means I won't continue to eat here pretty frequently. I love their egglessrolls, poboys (both Original and Argentine... especially the Argentine with extra chimichurri sauce). Their thyme fries are pretty good, but I don't really taste the thyme. I've gotten a couple bowls, which have been good but a little sparse on the mock meat. A cheap and delicious option is to get a side of lo mein with some mock beef.","3","2","3","3","3","3","1","2","1","2"

There are a few vegetarian side dishes, but if you order them on their own, the restaurant charges you much more than if they were a side dish to a meal, yet the serving size is the same.  We would gladly pay more for an entrée size of one of the appetizers.  But being charged extra when no other vegetarian entree's are offered, is insulting.  My meals there have been good for the most part.  Although the last time I went I had a tuna steak that was way overdone which made it dry and tough.  I really liked their crab chowder though.  Unfortunately, I probably will not go back again unless they add a few vegetarian dishes to the menu as I usually dine with my husband.","2","2","2","2","3","2","3","2","2","3"

We ordered chai which arrived lukewarm and watered-down. When we told the waiter that the tea was not hot, he casually glanced out the window and said ""Well its too cold outside to make the tea hotter"". (Sassy, we laughed but still didn't get hot tea)

The food is below average and over priced. Service is bad and as slow as it can be. I'm pretty sure my table was forgotten multiple times.

He slept in a crate at night (like he's used to at home) and then played with all the other dogs from their daycare service in their large outdoor play area. I opted to not have him get a bath at the end of the week to save some money. That may have been a mistake because when I picked him up he smelled the worst I've ever experienced him smelling. I assume that was a product of all those days of playing with big slobbery dogs. Just by smell alone, I'm sure he had a lot of fun being here.

Number One Pho hit all the marks of a good pho restaurant for me, and their menu also includes some other favorite Vietnamese entrees, like clay pot fish, which I love and will go back for.

On street parking was pretty ample on a Wednesday afternoon, on Superior right in front of the restaurant. it was well after lunch rush, around 2:30 and we were greeted and seated promptly. There is ample seating in a nice but not upscale dining room. We ordered drinks and a fried tofu appetizer. They came our quickly, the fried tofu was hot and crispy and a dipping sauce based in fish sauce was sweet and tangy, really good. There were cucumber and carrots with a slight pickle on them that were also good, very fresh and refreshing. The pho was very good also; the broth is always the star. This particular broth was good;not overly rich but importantly not overseasoned and not salty. Sometimes pho broth is overpowered with aromatics but this broth was more honest in the natural flavors. The meat and tripe was very good, the noodles plentiful and with basil, sprouts, peppers and lime the bowl was very good. The service was outstanding, though very attentive but not overbearing. We got the Tofu ($5), two big bowls of pho ($9 each) and one drink ($2) so lunch was $25 for two.","2","2","2","2","2","3","3","3","1","3"

The pomegranate martini is one of my favs. The spinach artichoke dip, crab balls and calamari are usually always ordered when I'm with a group of friends..and when my friends and I can spend less than 50 bucks as a group for food and drinks..we're usually pretty happy!

We reserved our car from Europe before leaving to Las Vegas. We payed for a compact car, that was one of the cheapest cars after the economy class cars. When we go there, we notice we were given an economy car. Well, ok. We decided to go back to the airport to let the staff know they had probably made a mistake. This was the worst part, as one of the employees was really rude with us. She said they barely have compacts so if we wanted we could wait there for hours but it was hardly possible we could get a car like the one we payed for (with a trunk for our suitcases). The only solution they provided to us was paying 400 extra dollars to get a normal size car with a trunk. Of course this was not an option as we had already paid almost 700 euros already, so we respectfully pointed it out, but the same employee screamed at us in front on everyone saying the car we had was the one we had paid for. We didn't wanna ruin our vacations so we continued with the same car. Last but not least, the car got a weird engine problem so we had to change it in Los Angeles. A nightmare.

I had chicken the day before and was eating hummus and veggies for lunch all week so those two choices, which would have been at the top of my list from their menu, were not as enticing to me at that point in my stay.

I say splurge, but really I got an amazing deal straight off of Cosmo's website.  If you can afford it, YES IT IS WORTH IT!  Just the balcony itself was out of this world and totally worth the extra $$ to upgrade the view.

There is something about the casino floor itself that I do not enjoy.  I think it is the low ceilings.  But since I am not a gambler, I am content to hang out at the Vespar bar or Chandelier both of which are ultra cool. When this place first opened in December of 2010, I knew it was only a matter of time before people grew tired of the latest offering.  Then I went here and realized that Cosmo's appeal is long-lasting.

My very first impression of the business is their lack of upfront pricing. It wasn't a problem to ask what the services would cost, but to my horror I was not expecting the outrageous high pricing that was presented to me.  The sales consultant had very little sympathy to my plight and offered no options to me other than ""take it or leave it"".  All I needed was a simply resize, battery replacement, and band attachment. Since My only option was to resort to their demands, I wondered the mall waiting for my pick up. When I arrived their 6 minutes to closing, the same sales consultant explained to me thru his closed mall cage that they are closed. I asked him to elaborate why they would be closed 6 minutes before closing, he bantered that their shop closes 15 minutes before mall closing and that my watches were thrown into a time lock safe. I asked him why he didn't explain to me why they closed 15 minutes. He whimpered that he told me to back by 20 minutes. Which under my impression he said 30 minutes. He not only had my number to call me to inform me, but another sales consultant was in the back giggling.  It was clear to me that they were more concerned about their weekend than customer service. Since no where does it say the shop closes 15 minutes early. Reacting with frustrating on my part they simply did not care.  What ever happened to customer service.

"RkNHU_-5S2WOjKVKrxcAIg","Sushi Guru","I was passing through town on my way to South Carolina for sports business, as usual and was craving sushi so I went to the Cowfish. There was a 2.5 hour wait, so I decided to go across the street and try Sushi Guru. I actually walked past the place because it is in the right corner of the building.

I was quickly seated seeing their was hardly nobody there at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I asked the waitress the heat difference between the spicy tuna and extremely spicy tuna. She responded with ""It's hot."" I thought to myself, duh, but what would the heat level be compared to? Anyways I got the extremely spicy tuna, Philly, crunchy, and California rolls. The extremely spicy tuna was hot but not what I'd call extremely hot. The Cali roll was a Cali roll, and the Philly was a Philly, nothing special. The crunchy roll and rolled in potato chips and fried instead of tempura flakes. It had an interesting taste and was pleasing. They are a sushi bar that loves to pack the cucumber in their rolls which overpowers the flavor in your mouth.

The big negative is they don't have a fountain soda machine, They serve you cans. Don't know if they charged by can like Ru-San's because I only had one, and the waitress checked on me twice in the 30 minutes I was there. That's bad seeing the final 10 minutes I was there I was the only one there.

Overall Sushi Guru is O.K., and is a good backup plan if you wanted to go to the Cowfish and they have an eternal wait, and in need of a sushi fix.","3","1","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"

About a month or so later we finally closed on our house and we called Ted up. Cathy (his sweet wife) came out to look at the house and my color choices. She said she could start immediately. It took only a 1 1/2 days for them to paint my 1,800 sqft house. After they finished and and we looked around, I was in complete awe of how beautiful it was.They even fixed stuff the previous painter messed up!! I was close to tears and felt they helped make my house a home. I will be calling them again soon to paint my shutters (after HOA permission). I am a customer for life!!!!! Thank you so much Cathy, Ted, Martine, Juan. You guys are the best!!!!

I highly recommend using Detail Painting. They are absolutely amazing!","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

I walked in once with a dog I found running around the neighborhood and the staff could not find a chip so Dr. Besemer came out to help.  He was busy but made time for me.  He looked over the dog and could not find a chip, he also did a quick check on the dog and said that he appeared healthy. He didn't charge me for his time.   This dog became my third adoped dog.

"hCaAzhLFkM_FnxU658Ix0A","Boss Coffee","Neat little place :) Nice and out of the way of city congestion and traffic but still a comfortable area. Everything is neat and orderly with a sort of industrial-rustic feel; a real relaxed environment that wasn't too busy even in the middle of the day on a Sunday. Coffee and pastries were delicious. I went in expecting to see a sandwich menu based on a photo of their menu someone took but was disappointed to discover they aren't offering breakfast or sandwich items at the moment, because they want to start making them in house instead of getting them from a vendor. So not a full cafe menu yet but it sounds like they're working toward that. To my discredit, I based my expectation on a Yelp photo instead of their website menu, so I'm not mad.

I thought it was nice they have charge cables set out for mobile devices as needed, but are organized in a way that's not obtrusive or sloppy.

Free wifi obviously. I sat and worked at my laptop for several hours comfortably.

Nice view. I will definitely want to come back when the summer heat is over and use the patio.","2","3","1","2","1","3","2","2","2","2"

When you try to disconnect and then resolve further centurylink created problems you will spend hours with calls dropping bw transfers, being transferred and being kept on hold for a rep! I honestly can say this is by far the worst company I've had to deal with (after becoming a customer). I should also mention that 100 visa gift card I was to get 4-6 wks after having service never did arrive and like many things these days dealing with all the bs rather than spend hrs hashing it over I've had to say f-it!

It was my first time there and she walked me through the steps of how to get a card, which machines to use, where I could buy the soap... only thing she didn't do was fold my dried laundry! Heh.

Will remember this place for the future in the event that I need to get my clothes washed and ready.  Free wi-fi and a soda machine is convenient.  Oh and if you have a balance left on your card, you can redeem the card and any remaining balance if you like.

So, I've been planning a few birthday surprises for my boyfriend's upcoming birthday, and Julia Baker Confections have been nothing but fantastic to me! Kelly Beeby has guided me and recommended so many wonderful confections and treats that'll make our trip to Scottsdale so much...well- sweeter.

The meal was good- The dora fir fir was delicious and flavorful. When I went there for lunch, the  entrance looked so shabby in the daytime, it felt like I entered a restroom. The ambiance in the daytime is unappealing and made me uncomfortable. The food was bland and lacked flavor. I had the meat platter for $14.00 and received a good portion of food but not flavorful.

It is a bit pricey but very fun. The owner is a nice guy, unfortunately if you don't understand how the tipping works with your teppanyaki cook and they waitress you will be bothered about it. We tipped our teppanyaki cook $40 and our waitress was awful so we only tipped her $15 or $20. She came back to our table and asked if we were unhappy with our service and she even broke down how the tipping was handled with her, the cook and the bus boys.

There are about 6 practice fields which you can walk by and watch the players up close practicing, warming up, pitching practice, and scrimmages.   The main stadium where both the Dodgers and White Sox play is such a great layout.  There is not a bad seat in the house.  The players are all so close and it's quite easy to catch balls - you can even have them signed if the players are willing and get really great pictures.

Only bad thing is that most games start at 1:05 and it's like the hottest time of the day so your literally baking in the sun.  Make sure to wear lots of sunblock, and hats or get a seat behind  home plate because it's the only shaded area - bad part about those seats is that there's a net there so if your hoping to catch some balls you won't get any there.","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

They were able to get all the items off of my corrupted hard drive, put everything on my new hard drive, and helped me reinstall my programs.

The atmosphere's really neat-- cool Latin decor, intimate lighting, and hip music. The staff was super friendly, too. Shout out to Frank! You definitely helped make the night!

We ordered an array of things, but we probably could have been gotten away with just eating the complimentary chips and salsa. My friends all ordered different margaritas, and they were raving about the variety of options and the unique flavors that were offered. The food hit the spot, too, and was a reasonable price.

It actually wasn't necessary for us to even make one. It wasn't busy. I do like that they line the tubs with a plastic liner, I just hope it was a new, fresh one and they don't just rotate or reuse. I choose the deluxe pedi, which cost $35. They used a salt scrub & they do a stone massage. It was nice. I will say though, do not shave your legs the same day you get this service. I felt like I had horrible razor burn and the hot stones and towel they used burned the crap out of my legs. Wasn't their fault by any means though. I asked the woman to do a design on my big toes and she did a cute one. The total was $40. I left a $5 tip. If you pay with cash, you get $2 back, which was nice.

"-dwfuRRPqAg3YeL3XsCAmw","Au Pied de Cochon","The end of an era. It's sad to say, but now this place has lost its charm.

I've been a big fan for the past 6 years. But this was the most disappointing experience i've ever had... and i organized a trip of 20 including friends from around the world.

Everything was wrong this year. The tables were sticky. The service was terrible - almost comparable to a self serve cafeteria. The flavours were strange - a little too out there to even work. Dishes with too many competing flavours. Seemed like the dishes were simply conceived to make an outrageous point rather than a cohesive dining experience. Dishes were also hard to eat. The slight deviation towards more international flavours didn't work either this year. The quality of produce wasn't there surprisingly. The menu itself seemed rather lessened compared to previous years - i.e less of everything and all the good stuff that APDC is known for.

I wanted to keep these thoughts to myself, for respect to Martin Piccard, but the entire group felt the same way... and especially for those of us that do this annually, we all noticed the differences. It's sad to even think of this - the truth is this isn't an off year in our opinion - when you look at it over the years - the increased number of services days and services within the days itself has now taken it's toll on the restaurant - there is less love and more factory output - and this is just a result of popularity and a busy chef.

"duvPONn-Lv2sK8m7nCqm_Q","Tea Station","Tea Station is my favorite place for boba tea in Chinatown.  Their prices are definitely higher than most of the competition, but they do offer a discount on all to-go drinks.  And lets be real, some of the other tea houses in the area are just plain creepy.  The menu is extensive (over 10 pages of tea) and the atmosphere is nice.  This place is very clean- major bonus points, especially if you've frequented some of their local competition.  Tea Station is always packed, especially at night since they are open late.  My favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba, or the iced mixed fruit tea (although this one is super sweet).  My husband likes their fruit slushes.  This is a great place to get work done during the day (free wifi) or meet friends at night.  It is very popular for takeout drinks, in fact I always see 5-0 popping in here for their late night boba fix.  Service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side, especially during busy times.  I would not recommend the food (their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean, though perhaps they are an acquired taste!).  I recommend this place based on their atmosphere, tea, and the fact that they are open late.  This is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average take-out boba shop.","1","2","1","1","2","2","3","2","2","2"

The food was just okay. The rolls were very average at best, not tightly rolled. The Catepillar roll had a very sweet eel sauce (more like a maple flavored sauce) and it was hard to eat. We had to remind them that our order was not all complete...perhaps in the rush to get our food out so we could leave by the time they closed, they may have overlooked or order.

We ended up with a very early reservation which was fine, but we felt extremely rushed the entire time. We ended up having a 'romantic' dinner that took 30 minutes including dessert. I get wanting to turn tables, but if we wanted fast food we would have went to Nothing But Noodles and saved ourselves a bit of money!

I went with the Seafood Ravioli and my husband had the lasagna. I am not confident that this is house-made pasta as advertised. The ravioli had the black striping on it like the fresh pasta at the grocery store (Costco), and it tasted similarly. My sauce was very salty, and was lacking in any detectable seafood. For $22 it was a let down. My husband's lasagna was a much better choice though a bit pricey for what it was. The mango cheesecake was good.

In a nutshell, the food quality was not on par with other $20+ per person meals I've had. The atmosphere is much more casual and not very relaxing nor romantic (that's on us for choosing it).  Our server was kind and did a good job, but was going way too fast.

We walked onto the small, but comfortable patio and got right to it - beers for the boys (vodka for me, obvi), burgers for all.  The beer selection seems pretty great, although I didn't take a good look at it.  My boyfriend ordered a Christmas blend that was in limited production from a brewery and the bartender even offered to comp him a different beer if he wasn't pleased.

As for the food, thought it was pretty good - the onion rings were to die for (HIGHLY suggest you try these - it's for your own good!).  The burger selection is pretty extensive, although they can help you build your own - I wanted everything that came on a turkey burger, minus the turkey part (I needed to get my red meat fix in to satisfy me for the next month) and they were more than willing to make sure to fulfill my burgerlicious wishes (and if I remember correctly, at no extra charge - thanks guys!).

The space is really bright and fresh, and you can see the open kitchen if you're sitting on this side of the restaurant.  I have yet to sit in the back patio, but they have several tables there that are covered if you're looking to hang out without all the bugs swarming your food.

Speaking of food, let's get to the best part...the whole menu.  I'm loving the guac of course.  I mean, who doesn't like table-side guacamole???  I'm also a big fan of restaurants that will offer you veggies instead of chips for a slight upcharge.  Yes Please!

Although they are famous for their black bean burger in the Memphis location, I'm a huge fan of their plates and their chopped salad.  The short rib is so incredibly flavorful, and the ribs are pretty good.  If you're looking to just go all out, get the street corn.  You won't regret it.  Also, my favorite drink is the Pepe O'Mally...for all those Hendricks/cucumber drinkers out there, this is for you.

No doubt, I'll be back.  Not for the silent Ricky/Lucy projections on the wall, but definitely for the food.

The bartender was really excellent, chatting with us from time to time and in general doing his job extremely well. The other bartender was always flipping glasses and doing various bartender tricks, which was great entertainment.

I would give this place five stars, but shortly after we got there, the DJ for the night started blaring music when the bar was practically empty. It would've been nice if he'd started a little more quietly and then pumped up the volume when the bar filled up!

It's a little bit of a trek for me, but I'd definitely go back. Especially to try the food!","3","3","3","3","3","1","2","3","3","3"

Not that I'm complaining but it's so much better coming to this place now. I find the atmosphere have changed a bit too, it's more for a older crowd, not many young teenagers come to this location. Mostly family with children come here at night....

The food is really good though, they are currently have their summer specials here which I love! Their green tea ice-cream with waffle is a MUST TRY.

"MOTU5O3BZbSRov4hK5xYCQ","Donburi","A few of us yelpers came to Donburi on a Monday night after an elite even in need of something to soak up the alcohol.

Donburi is something akin to Japanese fast food. We were greeted with a warm welcome by the manager who was all smiles from beginning to end. Our orders were taken promptly and I opted for the chicken and egg donburi (rice bowl). The portion that was put in front of me was quite generous; the chicken was fairly tender and had a strong ginger taste. The rice was quite good and nicely cooked; the egg was mixed in with the chicken and kind of got lost. To be honest I would have preferred a whole fried egg over the bowl (like a Korean bibimbap) but sadly this is not what I got. Overall though this was a pretty good meal for a fast food type place.

The restaurant itself is new, bright, and very clean. The food came out quickly and as stated earlier the service was top notch, they even split the bills for our fairly large group. Donburi will not be the best restaurant you go to but if you are in Markham and in need of fast food, skip the drive-thru and come here (they are open late).","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3"
"XG2jElV3uX_x2I04dpKzmA","Pufferbelly","Had the all you can eat brunch buffet on Sunday (11 to 2:30 every Sunday). In historical Kent, this restaurant had a very welcoming and homely ambiance. Very old-timey, and the flags really brought out the patriotic feels, particularly because it was the day after independence day. The servers were really welcoming, and a free drink comes with the buffet too (I had the pineapple juice).

Even though the place was a really nice and welcoming experience, and the servers were super accommodating, the food was mediocre (probably because I only had the buffet style food). The sausage was a little cold, the sauce on the brisket was a bit too salty. The fruit and the pineaplle juice did not seem too fresh. I really enjoyed the eggs benedict though.

I also ordered an omelette. Apparently there was a malfunction with the pans, and it took a long time to get the omelette. The delivery was not great (picture attached). Although the omelette was really yummy, by the time I got I was already full.

I'm giving then the benefit of the doubt and assuming that the omelette malfunction thing was just a one time thing.  Overall, the experience was really pleasant, but the food could use a bit more work.","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

I got the bulger with eggplant, spinach, and lentils. It was fantastic. I added hummus for an extra $1 and the flavors were all exactly what I was craving. Everything looked so good I had a hard time deciding what to order! I will absolutely be back to experiment with some of the other offerings.

The build up was worth it they were very good. We also had some pan noodles. Those were very yummy. They're Thai Tea was definitely not the best I've ever had but their Passion Fruit Slush was pretty good. Their Mango Slush was alright. This place isn't very good for other dishes besides noodles.

I took a client here for dinner on a Thursday night before a night out. We ordered a bottle of wine and the calamari to start. The service was excellent, the wine was presented well, and the calamari was out of this world (I'm a bit of a calamari snob). I then ordered the Chicken Sicilian. I'll make this short...this is probably the best Italian food I have ever had and I used to manage an Italian restaurant. My client was also very satisfied as we were talking about how good dinner was for the rest of the night.

Again, I didn't experience the atmosphere of the main dining room which, from reading other reviews I could see as being kind of cheesy.

They didn't have the style I was looking for in store but I was able to pick a few gowns to try on.  They have a good selection of dresses and pretty up-to-date.  There are rows and rows of dresses in plastic covers.  After going to several other wedding boutiques..I really dislike looking at wedding gowns through plastic covers.  It's frustrating when you can't tell how the dress really looks and the salesperson is not there to help.

The salesperson who greeted us at the reception desk ended up helping me throughout my stay.  She was very short of words and emotionless.  I don't think she smiled once the whole time we were there.  Regardless, she was there to help and pulled a couple of dresses off the manikin for me to try on.

"ukUPTPoUb5drr9p4UXmcpQ","Pop's Philly Steaks","What the heck I thought food in Vegas was supposed to be dirt cheap. If you can get a steak and eggs meal for under $5 it puts Pop's $8-10 sandwichs into perspective. Sides are expensive too at $4 for an In-N-Out sized paper tray! =/

The did have variety on sides you can get cheez wheels, deep fried zucchini and deep fried okra. The side of sweet potato fries I ate wasn't bad at all, had good crunch (the number one thing I look for in a fry) and natural sweet potato flavor. The flavor was enhanced even further with this syrup dipping sauce that had a hint of cinnamon. =)

I don't get how people can eat Cheez Whiz it's so processed it can't even be called cheese! I just didn't grow up with it, but apparently it's THE topping to get for Philly Cheesesteaks. You can even get a side of fries slathered with it here.

This location was most likely converted from a Wienerschnitzel since it had the signature triangle roofline and drive-thru. The covered seating provided sheltered for our group when we experienced a spontaneous downpour during lunch. I enjoyed the mural of Benjamin Franklin affably holding a Philly Cheesesteak, just drives the point home that what is in his hand is indeed a Philly Cheesesteak and if you don't order one here you are un-patriotic! =p","1","1","3","1","1","2","3","2","3","2"

So I already wasted 2 hours of my life eating at this place, so I am not going to write a thesis as to why someone should not be a patron of this restaurant.  In summation, when we arrived we were harassed by the owner (acting as the hostess) for wanting to sit in the corner, served flat beer, and then interrogated by her after sending an order back for not meeting the clear specifications given to the waitress.  Living in Latin America and traveling in Asia for some time, I have been to a lot of hellholes, but this is hands down the worst place I have ever been.  Not only was the food lousy and way overpriced, but we were hassled by the belligerent, sarcastic, and condescending owner almost the entire time.

If you're going to play music, fine- but do you really have to start blasting the music so loud at 9am to the point that the window is shaking?

Their menu is delicious and there's a great variety of desserts. I would highly recommend their Taiwanese popcorn chicken for snacks, and my favourite dessert is probably their mango pancake.

The staff is friendly and they always do their best to seat you as soon as possible when it's busy. I notice that they all say goodbye when you walk out that door. I've been coming to Sugar quite often and it's one of my go-to places to eat when I'm eating with a friend. There has only been two or three incidents where it was moderately busy and our server forgot to give us our water (in one case) and didn't tend to our table after we had called (in another case).

I waited and watched as several other online orders were filled, despite having shown up after me. 45 min later, (yes, 45 min later!!) we were given our food.

The only good thing that came out of the two hour debacle was that the manager ended up at least reducing our overall bill.   Honestly when your server disappears for so long that you have to go to the bar to order a drink and ask the hostess if she clocked out and didn't tell anyone because she was literally nowhere to be seen that is not a good sign.

But the staff made it easy for me, they know exactly what they're doing. My advice to anyone planning to get married here is to get the streaming of your wedding live on the internet. I think you pay a little bit extra but it's worth it. We had family members watching from all over the country and it was nice for people to feel involved even when they can't be there.

If you are new to this place i recommend trying it more than once until you figure out what kind of sauce and meat you like with your food. You can get a bowl or wrap and you can get it stir fried as well. I like mine stir fried when i want all the ingredients mixed together but if i want it more of a salad i just stick with the bowl. I always get double chicken which their chicken is extremely flavorful. I also add their grilled zucchini and mushrooms and their peppers. The next step is figuring out your sauce. My favorite is spicy diablo which by any means it is not spicy. I also recommend the pesto as well. Then i add lettuce which you can choose spinach as well if you like, but i don't think spinach goes well with the pasta. I also add onions cucumbers artichokes and whatever vegetables you like.

I bought tickets from the LInQ box office and soon found out they charge $3 more per ticket. We did get $5 off per ticket as we showed our ticket stub from a show we saw at the casino a couple days before. But I think we could have done that at the High Roller office too. We had a 12 year old and a 2 year old, which were both free and they thought it was cool. We had 12 people in our pod and we could move around it freely and see views from every angle.

"WRU7PLmReFlDzZnjUi6ylw","Starbucks","Unfortunately, this was my worst experience at a Starbucks ever. I'd called an hour in advance (7am) for a Traveler on a Sunday morning; unfortunately, when I arrived (8am) it had been brewed but wasn't ready and packed. There were only two very slow ladies working on orders, drinks, and food. Typically you go to the pick up area to pay and pick up the traveler. Instead I waited at the pick up area for 10mins before the lady even made eye contact with me, then she told me I needed to go wait in line to pay. So I stood in line for another 15mins before paying. Finally, I paid and was handed the traveler pack with a bag of supplies. By this time the coffee was 30mins old. Then, I'm driving to my event and realize they didn't give me any hot cups, so had to turn around to get them... and of course waited 10 more mins to be acknowledged.

I understand being busy, but people order travelers for business meetings, moving/packing parties, charity events, seminars, racing/running/fitness events and need to arrive on time - otherwise the coffee is cold or people don't see it before the ever starts and it gets wasted. If a person says they have a call-ahead order or a traveler pick up, they should be able to go in, pay, pick it up, and get on their way. If a person goes in and comes back in 1-5mins later, it means something's not quite right... acknowledge them and resolve their issue immediately. Don't let them stand there waiting (again) while you service new customers.","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","1","3","3"

Also they are doing specials almost every night of the week.  We went for Taco Thurs.  $3 tacos and Drink Specials.  I know this sounds steep but I would call the tacos ""gourmet"" and 3 will fill you nicely.  Plus they ran some of the specialty drinks on special so dinner and drinks were a steal!

We went with a coupon for 2 for 1 buffet on seafood night.  It was alright, the line took us 30 minutes to get through but the food was on the disappointing side.  I like the all you can eat oysters, but they were dried out, not too unexpected at a buffet.  There is a pasta bar, but there was one guy making it and it took 20 minutes to get it.  The sauce was supposed to be alfredo; a good alfredo sauce should have your heart slowing down and wondering if you're next move should be to the ER, but the sauce was pretty runny and the lack of cream might have actually made it not unhealthy.

We went to the cafe another night, and the steak was pretty comparable to the Longhorn across the street which has 4.99 steak dinner, the one here cost 15.99 (OK, it did come with several fried shrimp).  The fixings were standard, broccoli and carrots with mashed potatoes.  Dessert was also uninspiring, caramel (again runny) apples with whip cream.

The Napa slaw was very good, but there was a huge portion of that on the plate.  I opted to upgrade my side to the skillet mac & cheese.  This was very tasty, but the up-charge was $4, which I thought was a little steep for that (the fries that come with the lunch are listed at $3.95 as a side item, the mac & cheese was $5.95, the up-charge should be $2 at most, right?).

I finished the lunch with the coconut cupcake.  I am very wary of coconut desserts as they tend to be overly sweet.  Not the case here, this coconut cupcake was perfect - the ""cake"" part was more like a shortcake than a cupcake.  The icing was a creamy toasted coconut, just sweet enough.  Perfection.

While I didn't have any drinks for lunch, I noticed that their wine selection and ""by the glass"" selections were excellent.","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"
"UG-WOGWKLch6qHLWJBZdIQ","Firepower","A decent-sized range and reasonable prices keep me going back to shoot at Firepower.  I've been to the range here 4 or 5 times, and it's not bad.

I really like the staff here.  When I have questions or need assistance, they have always been friendly and helpful to me (although, admittedly, some of them come across as a little gruff).  They have a nice, decently-priced selection of guns you can buy here, although their rental section is a little small (and their ammo prices are just so-so, but I think that is normal).

For an indoor range, I think the lanes themselves are a good size.  I don't feel cramped or feel like there are too many people in the room.  They are not terribly well lighted, though, which can make for some difficult when shooting.  The range prices are pretty reasonable, and ladies can shoot there for half price on Tuesdays, which is AWESOME (and when I usually go).  The ranges seem relatively clean, but just watch for the occasional stray shell from the booth next to you.","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","3","3","3"

Even the bouncers sort of the looked goofy and academic.  Forget about what people looked like, they were basically a lot of wierdo's.

Perhaps I stopped by on a off night, but it I would have to agree that the crowd was not attractive.  If your gonna go out, might as well choose a place that has a sexy crowd. otherwise why deal with the headaches, might as well have a fun night at O-Shea's","3","3","1","3","3","1","1","2","2","1"

I explained this to Misty and she understood the problem completely. Almost 3 weeks later and NO LIFTS. That is why I am now a loyal customer four months later.

They give you gloves a bib and wrap the table up in plastic so you can enjoy the seasoned bags of seafood. My favorite is the hot n juicy spice and if you're sensitive to spice definitely go with baby spice because even the mild has a major kick. I also always order a side of butter and extra lemons.

I usually order the snow crab legs and my husband loves the shrimp. This time I did it big and ordered a pound of the king crab legs and it was totally worth it, although it does cost significantly more. Even though I only got two king legs they were huge and there was probably way more meat in them than all of a portion of the smaller snow crab legs. I also highly recommend ordering the corn on the cob because it comes seasoned in the bag. If you're hungry order a side of fries because they're seasoned really well and you're more likely to leave feeling full.","2","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

For one its unsanitary for the workers to go unlock the bathroom every time and secondly it is just purely annoying and an inconvenience. So then I proceed to ask if she could unlock the restroom when she is done with the customers and didn't respond ( hey I will be with you after I take care of them) no she said nothing. So once she finished with them she unlocked the bathroom for me and when I went into the bathroom she said next time the paying customers come first.

To be fair, the pasta I had was amazing... but then they took it off the menu. Just so you know, the chestnut and sheep's milk raviolini fandango that you will never have blew my mind thrice over and now it's gone forever. Dead.

Here's the part that didn't work out: the pizza. What the deuce? It's a pizza place that's supposed to have great pizza. 0/3 liked it. The tomato sauce was weird and clashed with the toppings, the crust was forgettable, and I didn't finish it. And I am a human garbage disposal in the presence of fancy pizza.

I was greeted by a girl with long hair as soon as I walked in. She said hello from the back of the store & stayed at the front area, where I was shopping. I picked up a pair of jeans and automatically, she asked if she could get a dressing room started. Didn't have a problem with that, until after every item I picked up she kept bugging to take them from me... I mean, it's kinda nice since I was pushing my baby around in her stroller, but I felt an awkward, uncomfortable vibe.  Almost as if she was following me around. I know what it's like working retail, been there & done that, but even on a slow day, you shouldn't chase your customers around the store. Let them be!

When I went to try on my clothes, another lady put me in the handicapped stall, but told me I couldn't bring my stroller. MY CHILD WAS SLEEPING. They expected me to change with the door wide open & my baby waiting in the doorway... I mean, I'm comfortable & I understand people aren't kid friendly & worry about shoplifters, but I didn't expect this to be taken to such a stupid extreme.

"6j15xCag3aEs1LfPX9pIEQ","Bellagio Hotel","This hotel has really gone down hill since my last visit.  The room we were initially given had several broken items, including the drapery, 3 lightbulbs were out in the room and bathroom.  The kicker, and the reason I will NEVER stay here again;  MOLD!!!  So gross and awful, the bathroom had mold growing in the shower from the base to 3' up the wall.  I can live with some mold in a corner here or there, but this was just the worst I have ever seen in any hotel.

We asked to change rooms and that took 4 hours for a room to become available, all while we needed to shower.  We were as nice and as understanding as could be and were surprised at what was offered for compensation for the inconvenience; A $50 credit!  Really?  I did get a letter in the mail from Bellagio offering a free room upgrade to lake view on my NEXT visit... They should have tried this on my last visit and I may have considered a return visit.

I must say, I write this with much sadness as I have gotten to know many of the staff members in the restaurants there and have enjoyed them tremendously over the years and they are the reason that I even give Bellagio 2 stars.

Free serve-yourself chips and salsa are pretty good.

When I took the portrait to them to re-install in the frame, they noticed a small place that had been damaged on the portrait itself and took the time to carefully match paint and retouch the portrait as well as expertly repairing the frame.

My husband is a wings guy and he enjoyed them, though he can never get his wings spicy enough, so naturally, he didn't think they were as hot as he would have liked.

Yeah, they like to remind us that we can exchange a product, but honey, that's not the response we want to hear.

I was in town from the Bay Area and wanted to try something out and on this day, much to their disappointment, they were in the process of a samples inventory. Alllllllllll the sample packets were laid out behind the counter and when I asked them for a sample, without even looking, she said ""Nope, we don't have a sample of that one."" Honey, (honey #2 is not good) at least take a quick look behind you at the ginormous pile of samples and then you can respond with the ""we don't have that one"" response.

At this age, it is a toss up whether you'll get any good shots, regardless of the photographer!  I didn't get her name (receipt says Amanda P.), but the photographer we had was great.  My son is usually a bit reserved, but he warmed up to her quickly.  She took her time and did not try to force shots just to get us out the door.  I had to fix my son's hair in the bathroom and it was still a bit wet when we arrived.  She was more than willing to hold off for a few minutes so that it could dry and look nicer for the pictures.  I'm sure she might not have that luxury if they were busy, but I appreciated her willingness to not rush us through.

Never in any city on this continent have I been to a place where there just isn't a line. Regardless if you have VIP, guestlist, general admission. It's just a pile of people standing outside a roped area wondering what the hell to do. No organization whatsoever.

I love Planet Hollywood as a casino, but you guys need to put together a better club, period. Your bouncers pocket more money than your club, I can damn well guarantee that. I had to flash a $20 to even get someone to come over to me even though I brought the ladies. It's pretty pathetic for anyone to ever want to come here. My suggestion to you is don't. The place isn't cool enough nor big enough for you to live it up Vegas style. They'll let 16 douchebags in and totally mess up the ratio of women to men just because they can, but if you are looking for a professional, upscale club you are looking into the wrong place.

I wanted to try another flavor but to donuts are HUGE and for the price didn't want to throw away a 1/2 eaten donut. The donut itself is very cake-like, the glaze had good flavor and was not overly sweet and the donut was not overly glazed. I took a few bites and left the rest sitting in the car while I ran some errands. A while later I decided to have some more donut and letting it sit in the warm car was the key to donut heaven! After sitting the glaze soaked into the donut and they were both nice and warm.. even the BF agreed it was even better than earlier. I can only imagine what a fresh from the kitchen donut tasted like there, drooling thinking about it.

The prices are higher than a DD or KK, but you are paying for local ingredients, locally made product and not some pre-fab box/bag filled with ingredients you cannot pronounce donut.

We were mostly there for the experience of letting our young kids pick apples, so we probably picked for a total of 20 minutes before our one bag was full. The Spartan and MacIntosh apples we picked were fresh, crispy, and juicy. I don't believe there is an entrance fee to enjoy the play area, rather, you just pay for what you pick (small or large bag). I found it reasonably priced, also because there were slides, swings, a hayride, and a petting zoo for my kids to enjoy after we finished apple picking.

There are picnic tables available if you want to sit down and pack a lunch.

Peameal, which I hadn't heard of before, seems to be variety of bacon with a specific preparation method and rolled in pea meal (possibly corn meal nowadays).  Paddington's is on the second level, Front Street side, and has a restaurant area in addition to the takeout counter.

The peameal sandwich comes as several slices of peameal bacon on a basic roll, on which you ask them to add from a selection of toppings, including tomato, shredded lettuce, banana peppers, relish, ketchup and mustard.  Overall, the bacon is good and the sandwich satisfying enough, but nothing special and I'd try another place next time.

All of their noodle dishes are amazing, and I really like their house special beef hue soup. The spiciness that they prepare their dishes with really adds flavor, and it's not just ""spiciness for the sake of spiciness"" -- it really enhances everything. That comes hand-in-hand with a warning though: the spiciness levels are far hotter than what you'd see in an Americanized place; a ""medium"" here might be off-the-scale spiciness at a more tame place. If you're adventurous, you can ask them to go off-the-scale here too (""extra"" or ""dragon"" hot), but I only recommend this if you're very seasoned to spiciness. Just the normal ""hot"" satisfies this happy customer, who normally orders ""15"" on a scale of ""10.""

Bonus: their spring rolls are also prepared very well, with excellent crisp and stuffing.

If I'm ever in the Cleveland area, I plan to take a special trip to this place.","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"

Please do NOT use this company!! Go somewhere else!!","1","1","2","1","3","1","1","1","1","1"
"XGeiaaKx-Jq3Ri7g3VWWYg","Romano's Macaroni Grill","I have frequented Macaroni Grill fairly often with my sister and my mother.  I usually enjoy it.  I walked to this restaurant from my hotel.  A dish that I have had several times was overcooked.  The penne rustica was clearly overcooked with little sauce.  The butternut squash dish also was over cooked and portions looked burnt.  I did not try to send it back because it was late and the restaurant was getting close to when it closed.

when I pointed it out to the server at the end that i did not believe it was up to their standards, he thanked me for telling him and explained the pancetta is normally chewy.  I have had this dish several times and know what it should taste like and tried to explain it.   That was all said to me. Nothing else.

Very disappointed.","3","2","2","3","1","2","3","2","2","2"

I purchase my car earlier this yr in June 2015, after having the car for almost a month noticed I got a low tire pressure indicator. Checked the rim and it had two welds on it. Contacted general manager Don H. He blew me off and told his lil side kick Don B to deal with me. They end up replacing my rear rim however after going back n forth w/ SD BMW rep, they denied to replace my rear tire that cost $416. After reviewing my purchase contract they also short change me on my reg. Try owe me additional $140-$160. I'm out $570 ish.. my lawyer sent over a demand doc and I just got a call from Don B. right now and he stated they not doing nothing about the matter. Think twice before buying any cars from this stealership, they will will treat like you don't exist after you get a car from them.","1","1","2","1","3","2","2","1","2","2"
"hptXL1d5xWdYcOcOrsLNjg","Professor Nails & Spa","I honestly love this place. The moment you walk in, they have this elegant vibe. Haha. The place is clean and they offer complimentary water, coffee and tea. Their selection for nail polish is pretty good compared to other nail places. In addition to that, i feel like their service is amazing. The front desk was very welcoming and helped me get my pedicure asap without any appointments. Their nail techs are also friendly and very professional.

So aside from how the place looks and the people are, the service is super relaxing. I can't find another place that offers a scrub and hot stone massage for $30 dollars. They offer green tea, lavender, lemon grass, and mint scrubs. Their scrubs leave your skin refreshed and smelling natural. After the scrubs, they follow up with a warm lotion massage with the hot stones! I loved this part. They spend about 5-7 minutes massaging your feet and legs. As they massage my feet and legs, i was also having fun with their massaging chair. It wasn't any cheap massaging chairs.

So if youre looking for a place to relax and receive great service check this place out! Reasonable price with a luxurious vibe!","3","2","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"
"n5xIDwys1RA07QLTr9KtWg","Potatoland","If there is one thing which certainly gets the thumbs up from me it is generous portion sizes.  Thankfully Potatoland fufils this essential criterion as they only sell big, man-sized, crispy-skinned, fluffy-centred potatoes.  Both times which I went in my first year I got my potato filled with a generous helping chilli con carne which was delicious and easily sufficed for a lunchtime meal on its own.

There is, however, room for improvement in Potatoland.  Being nestled away deep in the tail end of Clerc Street it is up against serious competition and, in my opinion, it would benefit from several key adjustments.

Inside the place it feels dark, dour and almost cramped.  Further, the selection of fillings just isn't adequate when compared with some of the sandwich shops nearby which are also baying for customers.  Chilli, beans, cheese or tuna mayonnaise were some of the only options available and one can't help but question their lack of imagination.  Nonetheless, Potatoland is a great little business which should be worthy of competing with the best in the area.","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

But I've actually had a ton of fun here with my friends.  There are certain nights when the arcade games are free but if you ask me they should be free all the time. My friends and I combined easily spent $100 on mixed drinks. And we were so busy having fun we weren't tracking what we were spending on the booze.  I'm sure I'd go on nights where the games cost but I don't know if I'd bring that much money with me to spend on games. I'd probably more sit, drink, and talk than play.  If you want a really casual fun night out with your friends, I'd suggest this place and I think it could even be a really fun first date.","1","3","2","2","1","1","2","2","2","1"
"ODRs5xdjVs-NchMyXkJYCA","Mirto Italian Restaurant & Bar","Went on a Monday night and the place was practically empty - we were there about 90 minutes and including us there were only three tables seated at any one time and only five in total. I expected it to be slow, but not dead. At least the service was decent as there was no way the wouldn't be able to keep up.

You expect a good Caesar at an Italian restaurant - not so much at Mirto. No romaine lettuce and only a passable dressing. The cheese was pre-grated. It was disappointing. Next up was the rigatoni - extremely salty! I like salty, but this was too much. Next was the chicken which was pretty good.  Desert was good.

Decor is nice, but run down. Presentation of the food was very good. Looks like they're struggling and cutting corners where they think nobody will notice. Decent value with the Groupon, but won't be going back - Mercato down the street is a better bet.","3","2","3","3","2","2","2","2","3","2"

I was dropping some luggage off to get repaired and thinking about trying to get a last minute facial to start my weekend. When I was pulling out of the lot, I saw this salon, called at 2:30pm and had a facial appointment at 4:30! The woman (Ruth, I think? I'm horrible with names) was wonderful! We discussed my face type and then customized a facial to help with my skin. It was wonderful and so relaxing! They use organic products. And she is hands down the only person that has never made me want to cry during extraction! She has a light, soothing touch. I am beyond thrilled with my experience and cannot wait to go back!

"ZwYbCFcj9u_YAB5yIGdFDw","My Nail Salon","My mom and I met at the salon. We didn't have a lot of time so I asked when we came in if there was any wait for two pedicures. They said no wait and sat us down immediately. Someone started working on my mom right away, but started her pedicure out by telling her they did not like the color she chose for her nails.  I thought this was odd but figured at least she was honest. 20 minutes later no one had come over to start my pedicure. I asked if I could soak my feet and they initially said no, only said yes after I asked why... they didn't want my feet soaking for too long. hmmm.  Then they told me someone would be over in 3 minutes. 15 minutes later finally someone came over to me but by that time it was too late. I told her I had to be home in a half an hour and she said that the pedicures only should last 30 minutes anyway.  I ultimately did not get the pedicure.

The salon also smelled a lot stronger than most of polish/remover etc. It was a little uncomfortable.

Even though it is the closest place to my house I won't be going back.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","2","3","3"
"zW611AxH7ZY7V_oDmsATpg","Hungry Hollow Smokehouse & Grille","If you are looking for a case of the meat sweats this is definitely the place to go! The pulled pork, ribs, and rotisserie are extremely tasty. We love the buffet of BBQ sauces to accompany your meat selection.

The redneck poutine is fantastic. Huge and filling! Chicken tenders are ok, the typical frozen and deep fried kind, but not terrible. Portions are big, and prices are reasonable.

I know they get their ground from Pat's (our favourite butcher) and he's got the freshest meat around! It's self serve, so you order at the counter. They get busy and sometimes that slows down food delivery but everything is hot and fresh when it arrives at your table.

Although if it's not first thing in the morning do expect to wait in line to fill up. The workers are chill, very nice.

I am not really a lover of fried chicken but I thought theirs was pretty tasty. The batter was a little salty for me but it fries up nice and crispy and they recommend a honey sauce that mutes the saltiness a bit. I also got the side orders of mashed potatoes and the collard greens which were good as well.

They have bowling lanes both downstairs and upstairs and a stage for performances each night. From what I gathered some performances are free and others have an added charge.","3","2","2","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"
"XmX_0zEkIhyKLZoLO4NZYw","Rush Espresso Cafe and Wine Bar","Rush is my go-to coffee spot when I'm at the office and can get away for a little while. When you walk in, you immediately notice the modern, European aesthetic: lots of sleek black and metal accented by splashes of red. Most coffee shops tend toward the cozy, which is not a bad thing, but Rush's approach is welcome.

Fortunately, the coffee is high-quality as well (and also European). I have to admit, I didn't really care for the brew when they were serving Illy, but LaVazza is a much better label according to my taste buds.

Two more things I appreciate about Rush: the loyalty punch-cards and the fact that the owner remembers my name, even though I am sure he has customers who are much more frequent visitors than I.

If you're in Ballantyne, Rush should be high on your list of coffee options.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"
"07QQwsMRegA3eMhwfaIfig","Churrasqueira Costa Verde","This Brazilian/Venezuelan mix on traditional portuguese chicken is a great spin on the otherwise dry less flavorful chicken in the area. They offer chicken 2 ways , on the grill BBQ style or rotisserie. The chicken is marinaded in a tangy blend of olive oil, herbs and lemon juice which is to die for and keeps the chicken moist and tender... The piri piri sauce they serve on the other hand is not the best I've had. I'm not even sure if it's homemade... It has a very distinct resemblance to Tabasco sauce . The sides are great. They have many different dishes that range from cultural classic dishes like bacalao and homemade rice and potatoes to healthy options like Coleslaw and chick peas. They make a mean French fry too.... Best I've had surprisingly . It must be the oil they fry them in because they have an addictive quality to them.... The worst thing about this place is the customer service. There's no organization in the ordering process and don't expect a pleasant hello . They definitely don't have the best people skills but can cook a mean chicken and make you come back to face them again.. Lol... But don't let that discourage you ... The chicken is what matters...

There are places that sometimes don't allow you in at brunch time if you're not eating, and they were totally fine with allowing me to have my own table for just coffee. Good music, too.

I like it there. It's an easy going vibe, not pretentious at all, and though I haven't eaten at the new location, the plates of all the brunch-goers nearby looked full and yummy.

He said and I quote exactly, ""A two some has no rights on a golf course."" I told him I guess that wasn't mentioned when I booked a tee time for 2 and he did not care. I don't enjoy paying for something then being bossed around. I of course did not do as he asked but I feel bad because the 2 older gentleman in front of us were so scared of him...

The bread is pretty amazing but I've gone to cheaper places that have had just as good bread.

Once our plates arrived the food was good but we didnt have very much food on our plates. I was very disappointed by the $$$ to amount of food we were getting. In addition to the food, it was VERY loud and I think a lot of it comes from the kitchen being right off of the dining room.

Luckily we didn't leave and to my surprise the line zipped by and everything we ordered was delicious.

Besides their good food, I was pleased with their customer service and speed. Everyone was friendly even though the place was crowded with students and business people on their lunch break. The manager (?) came around and asked how everything was and gave my family children vouchers for free meals the next time they visited. We were happily surprised with the service and thoughtfulness and a little later when leaving another employee asked if we had a good meal.

"vg0MQQ_i0hDqUMb3rFtoCw","Chez José","Chez Jose an airy little cafe with a whole lot of character. While one wall is painted in zebra print, another is adorned with sunflowers, and the next with colourful fish. On hot summer days, other than the few tiny tables that line the perimeter, seating is limited to the inside on your choice of an eclectic collection of mismatched wooden chairs. Don't worry if you had hoped to do some people watching or sunlight absorption, it's all still possible with the windows opened wide.

A white board lists the combinations of fruit smoothies made with 100% orange juice available. A glass display case shows off the drool-inducing assortment of pastries. Sandwiches and salads du jour keeps things fresh and light.

You'll want to make sure you've got cash with you though since they don't take cards. If you find yourself cashless and hungry (and lazy) though, the dep next door charges $2.25 for ""cash back"", purchase optional.","1","2","3","2","3","2","2","1","2","2"

There are two menus when using the drive thru -one before you enter and one above the you vehicle when you order. If it sounds confusing, it is. You don't really get a chance to look at the menu without holding up the cars behind you. Because of this, we had to resort to asking the employee what he recommended.

So the fries were, while a bit greasy, good. The sandwich?  Well, the meat was, while sparse, real.  The ""swiss cheese"" was...um....interesting.  The bun was HUGE.  Overly so.  REALLY overly so.

The service was awesome. Sat at the bar, and the bartender was all over making sure I was satisfied.    I ate about half the (sparse) meat, and left the HUGE bun alone, along with the 24 gallons of fries.  He was truly concerned that I wasn't happy with the meal.  Kudos.

There are a ton of different kind of slots, gaming/poker tables, a crap ton of mini restaurants or bakery stands and shops. There is so much to see and do for someone who wants to do it all!

The hotel itself is old, but nice. Kind of reminds me of part of the Planet Hollywood layout actually. Literally same layout just roomier. Our room was teeny bit bigger for 2 queens. I mean, the corridor from the room entrance to our beds included a cute small vanity with a bench to get ready, a quite large bathroom with a huge tub, a shower, 2 sinks and a room for the thrown. I think the room alone could have fit at least 4-5 comfortably.

I checked-in around 230 and they were SO gracious to letting me check-in a little bit early and I got to relax for a bit before I took my adventures on the strip. The view was amazing of the pool! Definitely nice for the summer time, not so much for spring-time sand storms. The towers I would say are kind of far to get to but you get used to it.

The week I came unfortunately did not have any great performers like Celine. But I will make it a must-see next time I come to Vegas. The taxi line was one of the easier ones to figure out in my opinion. It is crazy busy though so plan accordingly! Oh yeah, and check out the buffet downstairs!

Driving past it regularly, I just assumed it was a pub/grille serving bar food but I was wrong.  It's a great restaurant with really good food.  I've been here twice and we've loved all our meals.

Most recently we started with an artisanal cheese plate (they kindly left off the meat for us and gave us extra cheese), a house salad, vegetarian ravioli and a burger.   The sweet ravioli was in a brown butter sauce with carrots and pumpkin seeds.  Loved it.  They do change up the menu to be seasonal.  This past fall I had butternut squash ravioli that was equally good.  The house salad is a little on the small side.  They also have a nice selection of wine and beer.

I recommend a reservation as it does get crowded.  It's a relatively large place and there a several different rooms.  There is a library type area with a fireplace and the walls are lined with filled bookshelves.  I've also been wanting to try out the patio as it looks fun and relaxing.

The dining room was extremely hot.  The air conditioning was clearly not working and it was well over 80 degrees in the room.  The service was very slow and the food was underwhelming.  I had the ahi tuna with mango appetizer and there didn't appear to have been any sauce whatsoever.  Just chunks of tuna and pieces of mango.  Nothing to bring cohesiveness to the dish.  I'd requested a glass of wine with my entree, but after a while I asked my server for the wine anyway.  I also asked to be reseated in the outdoor section because the room was so sweltering that I was fast losing my appetite.

After asking a second time, my wine was brought to me, along with a small plate of cheese and sausage.  That cheese was the highlight of the evening.  But it did not make up for the shrimp and linguini that was my entree.  The menu said it came in a white wine sauce, but I could not tell because whatever sauce they used was very thick and cloying.  I was not able to eat but a few bites.  The service was so slow that evening that I noticed several tables being offered a dessert on the house as an apology.

I'm very disappointed in my experience as it was my last night in town and I chose Paris 66 over about 20 other restaurants I'd researched.  It cost more than I would normally spend for myself but I thought it would be a nice way to end my vacation.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

All in all a great storefront to purchase your every day parts or those hard to find ones. Recommended to the every day person or a full time technician such as myself.

"wru6tdmuL9j6F8iD8wWYcA","Buca di Beppo","Went there on Xmas night with reservations- the cascade of deficiencies made it downright comical by the end. With reservation, arriving on time, we waited 35 min to be seated. Our waiter Paolo was rude and inattentive. Both wine order and water refill request required reminders before they arrived. We received our appetizer twice. Thats right. They brought a very nice bruschetta. Ten minutes after we finished it, they brought another one, as if they had never seen us before. Later the waiter stopped by to say they were out of chicken and we needed to change our order. We switched to fett alfredo. Somehow it was cold when it got to us. And bland. No I mean very bland. When receiving the check we learned a probable cause for that- Paolo told us they had run out of cheese. I know, right? Italian Rest out of cheese? Paolo thought the reason was because they had been sending takeout orders out all day since 8 am. Said they had started receiving those orders over a month ago. That's right- the ONLY thing we must care about on Xmas day is your money. Shameful","1","2","2","1","2","3","2","1","1","1"
"Y0d13hC0i0LBr0RuD2ViHw","Hakim Optical Factory Outlet","I'd forgotten just how expensive glasses are but after receiving terrible service from the Lenscrafters in the Eaton Centre this was my first stop and the staff made me stay. Price is what I'd been expecting to pay at Lenscrafters anyway and I got two pairs with the discount they're running.

They were incredibly friendly and easy going; attentive when I came in, paid close attention to the style I said I'd prefer and gave me room to browse when I asked for it.

After I said I was fussy and I'd prefer to just browse the gentleman only came back twice to interrupt me with frames that we're incredibly close to what I said I wanted and suited my face shape. One of his suggestions ended up being one of the two I decided on.

They were done in a week; faster than I was expecting for two pairs of glasses both transitions, scratch proofed, and glare proofed and one set was even rimless. No issues with the craftsmanship they look good.","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

I was very pleased with the beer choices. Then we ordered an appetizer of burnt ends. The burnt ends were very good but we were disappointed with the portion size. The server said it was a 4 oz size. I literally could have shoved the entire appetizer (all 3 little tiny pieces of meat) into my mouth at one time - no problem. I really hate when restaurants get skimpy!

So We ordered pulled pork sandwiches snd they were good. We have previously ordered the platters and really liked them. I recommend spending a little more $ and getting the platters so you don't leave hungry. All in all, the meal was quite good but we left hungry after spending $50 for lunch for just two people.","3","3","2","3","1","2","2","2","3","2"

The selection was ok, typical buffet, with a few extra options and a mac n cheese bar.  It's just the food quality was poor.  I can usually eat about anything, but at the wicked spoon, I couldn't find anything that was good.  It just seemed like cheap food.  Just gross. For 35/ person totally not worth it.

I had the pulled pork burger and R had the classic with the mushrooms, Monterey Jack cheese, avocado, and Jalapeno peppers.  Not realizing how thick the burgers were, we also got the vidalia onion rings and the french fries and the mudslide shakes to top off the meal.

The shake was absolutely amazing and was enough for the both of us to share.  The burgers were HUGE!   I'm a pretty large eater, but there was no way that I could have finished both the burger and the onion rings.  It had just the right amount of coleslaw and sauce to make it yummy.   (I normally hate coleslaw, but this one was really good.  The best thing was the onion rings.  When you take your first bite, you can savor the crispiness of it, and the sweetness of the onions, combined with a little bit of ketchup, and I was in love.

BLT burger is not the cheapest place in town, which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  For the 2 of us, it came out to about $50.00 with tip.","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","2","2","2"

This time I did not receive a response.  They had their act together enough to send me a bill that I received yesterday with $30 in late fees.  How can they charge me late fees when they didn't even send me a bill and their system is not set up for me to do it over their website?!  They have not sent me my payment booklet for 2015 yet and I am not receiving a response via email to Michelle Ramsey or via phone message (left at the phone number referenced on my recent bill.

It also has a very nice feature, in that you have the choice to play the full 18 (which will take you a while) or to simply loop around for a quick 9 hole experience.  There have been a few changes made to it since it's inception for the better.

It's completely a tourist attraction, with a cheesy guided tour with Mary King's ""daughter"" but it was full with a ton of facts and stories of people who actually lived in the close and you get a feel for what life was like back then. If you're interested in historical attractions that's also family friendly and interesting, Mary King's Close is worth a visit.

She stands and stares at you and doesn't really answer questions directly.  Honestly she acts like she doesn't even know what she is talking about when she does answer.  She did a biopsy on my daughter and dropped the scalpel and the dripped blood all over her skirt!  And prior to the biopsy she wasn't even going to test my daughter for MRSA but was just going to prescribe meds without knowing what was growing on her leg!!!  Isn't that what started MRSA in the first place?  Over prescribing antibiotics?  When we thought my daughter was having an allergic reaction to the numbing shot she just stared at us and said ""that has nothing to do with this....do you have anxiety??""  I almost died!

And just to add to this she also makes you schedule an appt for every ""issue""....you can't go in for acne and a skin lesion.  You need separate appts (and co pays).  They also make you come in every 3 months to write you a new prescription so they can charge you a co pay as well.  Beware!!!!!!!!!","2","2","1","1","2","1","1","3","2","1"

There are two employees who operate the shop and are always most welcoming, friendly, and helpful. They keep neat and clean. There are several filling stations and I've never had to wait to fill up my 5 gallon jug. They do have two alkaline water station available, but it takes a long time to fill. Many people drop off their containers to have filled with the special water. They offer a $15 prepaid water card which gets you 40 gallons of purified. This is the method I prefer to use. Every visit, I show my card and get 5 gallons crossed off after a fill up.  You may also purchase various sizes of water jugs in both plastic and glass.

Besides water, you can get various treats too. The classic and most delicous Thrifty's ice cream is available in single scoop or hand packed quart size. You can also get a healthy treat of fresh squeezed wheatgrass and the customary orange wedge.

The staff was all amazing in every aspect, the course requires that you play with a caddy, and my looper was Brad - he was AWESOME.  Brad had all the course knowledge one could hope for, he easily shaved 5+ strokes off our team score based on his course insights.

Most important, the course is impeccably manicured, and was in perfect condition.  I can only imagine that as the heat comes, the course starts to 'wilt'.  In this case, it was April, and the course looked beautify.  I found every aspect of my golf experience to be exceptional.

I feel that the food is decent, but nothing special, also their plate of veggie is small as heck, like three pieces of carrots and an inch cube of tofu and like two slurps of udons... wtf, you'd think that the veggie are expensive as heck but no, it's just napa cabbage man. In the seafood plate they have some of the smallest scallops ever, I feel that for the price, it shouldn't be that small...

There's no service when I went there either, all they did was to give us menu, the drink, then brought the food then nothing. Had to wait like 15 mins for to find someone for the check and another 10 to bring it... and it wasn't even busy when we were there. (Just one other table)

However, the person at the register seemed annoyed at me when I asked about their Restaurant Week special and when I paid. He left before I handed him the signed receipt and told me to leave it on the counter, which I didn't feel very comfortable doing. The second time I went, I was charged full price until I asked about the Restaurant Week special. I guess this is understandable, but I didn't feel comfortable paying for my food.

With all the options for high-end dining in Vegas, this place should be an option out of desperation.  I could go on about how terrible the food is here, but the bottom line is that the Bellagio should be embarrassed to have this place in their hotel.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to charge $50 - $100 for a steak, you better be able to cook the darn thing properly.  Your pork belly steam buns shouldn't taste like you purchased them at Sam's or Costco and nuked them to order, your ""shaved seasonal vegetable salad"" shouldn't be 6 pieces of shaved radish and a couple pieces of carrot.  This place is a total rip off.  Don't get me wrong, the manager comped my steak when he saw it, as he should have, but you can do so much better dining in Vegas than this place.

Its also so much more affordably priced, and considering the quality of the product offered, its a hands down no brainer for me to shop there. The fact that the meat is freshly ground, with no added fillers or ""pink slime"" added is very evident. I was also told by one of the employees that they only keep their meat in the cooler for 4 days, VS 10 days in the big box stores. The first time I made a meatloaf using meat from Sweetberry, I was honestly shocked how little fat there was in the pan, and that gross gray stuff that oozes from most meat, wasn't there either. Their meat is fresh, and tastes so much better then other stores. The produce...OMG where to start. You can't get better quality or freshness, and the prices are unbelievable.  I honestly don't understand people who don't shop there. Its worth going a little bit out of the way, for the quality of the food. It can be a bit crowded, and the store really is small, especially at peak times, so getting around easily can be a challenge ,but all that being said...there ISN'T a good reason not to be a customer. The people at the check out are really nice, and I would much rather support a small locally owned business, then support a big box store. If you've never shopped at Sweetberry, what's stopping you? I'm just sorry it took me so long to discover it.","1","3","2","2","3","1","2","2","3","2"
"k1Uz_FOthOJzFzzyUYG6cg","Julian Serrano Tapas","My girlfriend and I were very excited to dine here but the food turned out to be appallingly bad, especially for the price. One of our dishes was described as eggs with chorizo on top of fried potatoes. The eggs were bland and mushy, the chorizo had the taste and texture of mediocre hot dog meat, and this restaurant actually had the gall to serve these things on top of pre-made french fries for $11. The other wildly overpriced ""tapas"" were consistently ill-conceived, poorly cooked, under-seasoned, or some combination thereof. I have never been actively insulted by food before, so the dining experience was unique in that respect. Julian Serrano should be ashamed. Avoid this place if you like food at all and have even a modicum of self-respect.","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","1","3"

We were sat by the window, with the blinds up so people can see the planes take off and it was hot and uncomfortable. We waited a while for our food but unfortunately the heat and stuffiness of being by the window kind of ruined the breakfast. It is still too hot out to have the blinds up and not enough cool air circulating. We were a larger party so we had no where else to sit. And my sister's step daughter found a small hair in her food.

"F1PiX_YKiFXHNxUBLpSJ8w","Lady Marmalade","Everything I've had here has been awesome. From the bennies to the baked french toast, they really know how to put together a solid brunch plate. And the breakfast poutine with miso gravy is interesting and delicious too, when available. The side salad that comes with many of the dishes is a highlight, too.

There is almost always a wait, and it sucks. But that's to be expected at a brunch spot this popular. However, the Leslieville stroller mafia makes a long wait even more annoying by insisting on piling their strollers up in the limited waiting space. Even more annoying is when one of them insists on a four-top for their party of two adults so they can park the damn thing right up at the table, with no thought to the larger groups waiting patiently in line.

Anyway. A soft egg yolk and some delicious roasted vegetables is all it takes to make those annoyances fade away, and thankfully Lady Marmalade has that well covered. But maybe they could gently suggest that the strollers be left outside...","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

The food looked & smelled delicious! I need to add that the Fanta was cold when it got here which was perfect! The food was definitely delicious! We were all impressed and super happy.

"QGUYDCcaJUk71KXUJjbWKA","Petco","Don't take your dog to this grooming salon. I took my recent rescue today for his first haircut. He is a yorkie-poo and I wanted him shaved off so he could regrow a nice curly coat. The staff who worked on him barely did anything. His face wasn't touched, ears were trimmed a tiny bit, inside his ears weren't touched, nails weren't trimmed or grinded at all, tail and his belly were untouched. I was still charged 56 dollars even though nothing I asked was done. I brought him to petsmart couple days ago for a nail grind and they were able to do it. The staff at petco just told me that he was a lot of work and screamed. I trimmed his facial hair 2 times since I got him a week ago with no problem, so why couldn't they?

They warned me that they wouldn't force anything on animals so they won't be traumatized, but charging me for a full groom just sounds too ridiculous. I asked for short hair, and they did not do it because he's too skinny and his bones would be visible. But I asked for it so I could grow a nice coat back. It's just unbelievable. They told me to bring him in next month so they could keep working on him. They even pushed an upgrade that would cost 78 dollars after I said ""no"" 3 times. I would pick petsmart over petco any day.","2","2","1","1","1","2","3","1","3","2"

It can get a bit crowded when everyone was waiting before the doors opened, but once you get in the theatre it is an amazing sight. We had seats towards the back of the theatre in the middle which was great for seeing all the action.

The show was simply amazing. Some of the stunts they performed were just CRAZY! I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the entire show. The main stage that could go vertical was really cool. Some of the scenes made you forget that these performers are actually dangling in the air.

Even without dialogue, the story was really easy to follow and was very entertaining. After seeing KA, I don't know which Cirque du Soleil show is my favorite, but KA is an excellent choice.","2","2","2","2","3","3","2","2","3","3"

I ordered the Bumblebee biscuit, it had just the right about of everything on it and the chicken was cooked to perfection. It was phenomenal. I love that the side dish is watermelon, what a great refreshing side. We also got a side of poutine fries that were delicious. It's a little messy and sticky, but totally worth it.

My only complaint was the lack of salami. When I first dug into the salad I thought they forgot it. I picked through and found five little slivers (think chiffonade) of salami.  If I'm ordering a chop salad I'm expecting a balance of meat cheese, and veggies. The cheese was great and much more of a generous portion. I would only order the chop salad again if the meat portion matched the cheese portion.","3","2","2","3","1","2","1","1","3","1"

Tecate and a shot of Cuervo (if you're nice, they'll swap it for a Jamison!).  The atmosphere is pretty cool, I dug the authenticity of the garage.  However, I'm slightly confused by the name, sort of makes me think of a trailer, not a garage.  I get it either way, it just seemed odd.  I suggest heading in earlier (before 2 P.M.) on a Sunday for brunch.  It's probably a bit fresher.  I had the Double Wide Benedict.  It's a tasteful deviation of Eggs Benedict using cornbread instead of an English muffin and bacon instead of ham.  They also throw some fresh spinach under the poached eggs.  My whole meal was a little colder than I like, but still enjoyable.  When I go back, I'm definitely going earlier and trying a Bloody Mary.","1","2","1","1","2","2","2","3","3","3"
"vxxqaz2JqPyUiitVQIHijw","Jasmine Grill","Great experience here! I visited for the first time for lunch on yesterday (Sunday), and enjoyed it so much that I also returned for lunch again today!  I will speak about both visits.

On my first visit there on yesterday, I had the mixed Kebab grill, and they kindly substituted lamb instead of beef (I also got the shrimp and chicken).  With this, my 2 sides were yellow rice and hummus.  Having used the Yelp app to check in, I also received a free drink offer, and was able to take advantage of that.  Lastly, I decided to also order their falafel appetizer.  Everything was great and very flavorful.  The price was exceptional.  I was thoroughly pleased and quickly realized that this place would be added to my rotation of yummy places to eat.

However I didn't know that I would be returning so soon!  I went there for lunch today with a co-worker.  We enjoyed the special for $6.99 (we chose the chicken Kebab with yellow rice, and that comes with salad and lentil soup).  Terrific deal...I appreciate that they don't skimp on the portion size though the price of this deal is amazing.  Like my experience on yesterday, today's visit did not disappoint either.  I thought (especially after reading the reviews) that it may be packed during the lunch hour, but thankfully (today, at least,) that was not the case at all.

Very satisfied with my experiences with Jasmine Grill... I will return again.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

And then of course there were the famous frites I'd heard so much about. The frites themselves were good, but what made them delicious was the aioli served with them on the side--amazing! My only complaint is it's a bit cramped. It was quite busy the night we were there, which made it difficult to maneuver through the tables. However, that is no reason not to give this place a shot. The food and atmosphere definitely makes up for it!","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

I had the Deluxe pedicure and the sea salt scrub felt amazing on my legs.  The massage was also really good.  So I really lost for words as to why others ranked them so low.   Maybe they had another nail technician.  The only reason why they didn't get a perfect 5 was because they are located in a mall.  And their salon isn't as posh as I'm use to.  I will most definitely be back here.  Just ask for Tim when you get a pedicure.  :)","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2"

Now, for my return I called up on Sunday 10:46 AM and despite the long hold time I spoke to a rep (Brianna) and requested a pick up. I was told to wait outside the hotel at3:20AM for a 3:30AM pickup. At 3:35 no shuttle, so I called Bell Trans and got a rep. She first acted if I didn't have a reservation. Then she told me that they were short drivers. After being put on hold for a few minutes  she said the shuttle would be there in 10mins. 15 mins later no shuttle and I could not get to a rep due to being on hold. I spent $40.00 for a cab and I'm out three return fares to the airport. Moral of the story: Buy a ONE WAY ticket. If they fail to show on the return I won't waste my money when I have to take a cab. Also should have paid with my credit card. I could have recouped my money through them.","1","2","2","1","3","3","2","2","2","3"

Finally she came back and took the orders, which took FOREVER to come out. There was a table of 4 right next to us who sat down after we ordered our food and got their food before us!

The food was not great. Well, my BBQ bacon burger was, but everyone else's food (ribs, bbq sundae, brisket) was sub-par. If this place is going to claim to be ""Texas Barbeque"" it had better follow through. And it didn't.

After we were all done eating, we didn't see the waitress for a good 15 minutes. When she showed up, she didn't have the check ready and she started clearing the dirty dishes instead of taking the ones we wanted to take home to the back to box them up. Then, she disappeared with the credit card for another 10 minutes.

Then we had to remind them that only 2 of the party received our drinks and we only ordered water and a coke but they couldn't remember we are the only people in the entire restaurant. Food was ok but it was so hot inside the place and when we asked if their air was working they acted as if they didn't know what we were talking about as my father in law was drenched in sweat and we ended up having him go out to the car and sit with the air conditioning while we boxed up everything.

I have been on a 6 year mission to find the best RVC in Phoenix.  So,  no surprise,  I stop in this little Shop when I notice that they have red velvet cup cakes and cake pops.   This review is completely based on the RVc.   I've only gone once and won't go back.   Very cute cupcakes and cake pops.   The coffee smelled delicious.   However,  that RVC is on the lower end of the RVCs I've had in Phoenix.   The RVC was very moist.   The chocolate flavor was present and noticeable.   But the cream cheese icing was almost non existent.  I could not taste it at all.  There is a trifecta for RVC.   All three are important.  I am sure other cakes there are good.

My boyfriend was taking me here, and he made sure to call ahead of time to make sure they could do something vegetarian for me, as the menu is very meat-heavy. There were no veggie main courses, but a couple of starters at least. We both opted for the table d'hôte, as it was only 14 dollars on top of a plat (all of which are around 24-30$) so seemed like a good deal. We both started with the cauliflower soup, which was nice. Then I had a beet salad that I really enjoyed (I love how beets are so popular in MTL at the moment!) and my boyfriend had a tuna starter which he said was amazing. For my main, the chef concocted a vegetarian gnocchi with asparagus, different veggies, and a delicious pesto sauce. The gnocchi was really good, with an amazing texture, and the dish overall was delicious. My partner had a fish main course, again which he thought was great. We shared the Apple & churros dessert (I LOVED the apples and ice cream, could have lived without the churros) and actually got our second dessert (the chocolate cake) to go because we were too full to eat it then.

Overall, the food was great, ambiance nice, and the service was very attentive despite the fact that they were really busy. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a special night out.","3","1","1","1","2","2","3","3","2","3"

The xiao long bao are fantastic. I've never eaten them in a larger city like NYC so I can't compare, but these are juicy with a skin that's just thick enough to hold in all the soup and pork. I like the dan dan noodles, which are peanutty and vinegary, and the minced pork noodles and spicy wonton noodles as well. Oh, and the scallion pancake. Get the scallion pancake. You won't be disappointed.

I have subsequently written review on another popular trip review site, mentioning that MGM customer service places no email or physical addresses on their website, suggesting they may not want to hear about any problems, and MGM had the audacity to write a response to that review suggesting I ""contact our main number and ask to speak to a member of our management team regarding your concerns.""  You mean call the same number I called in the first place?  The same number I called that told me they couldn't do anything for me despite keeping me detained in a hotel room without power for an entire night?  And tell them what?  If the people at MGM management were in any way interested in solving the problems and not just trying to smooth over bad reviews with empty apologies they would return a message, offer some way of contact someone who isn't just a phone operator (most likely in India) and actually provide some semblance of customer service.

The creme brûlée was amazing, probably one of the best I've had in Toronto. The food presentation was beautiful, and creative. However, portions were a bit small.

The atmosphere and ambience of the restaurant was good. A very nice place for a first date, or to come to a classy and fancy dinner. The server was good, and fast, although a bit lacking in communication. Also the debit machine was not working, which was a bit annoying.

Entree sized just means for $7 more you get 3 tacos instead of 2, plus rice and refried beans. Considering that most downtown taco joints charge $15 for 3 tacos, and this was around $18-19, it works out to be in the same price range.  All three dishes were spicy but delicious.

The dentists have terrible turnover.  In approximately 11 visits, I have seen 8 different dentists.  That would be ok if the quality of care was consistent.  I am not confident in their service, advice, nor care and would not recommend this practice.  Today, I have decided to leave and leave a review wherever I can.

I'm 43 years old with very good oral hygiene.  I have had six month check ups my entire life. At age 39, I had 5 fillings in my mouth - all from childhood.  On my first visit to this office after moving to Charlotte in 2010, I was told I had 5 more cavities.  I had Dentist W fill them.  In 2013, Dentist X said I had 7 more cavities. I had them filled.  In spring of 2014, my Xrays were deemed cavity free by Dentist Y.

Today, six months later, Dentist Z looked at those *same Xrays* and said they indicated that I needed *8* more fillings. He told me that Dentist X had done 2 of them incorrectly and that Dentist Y must not know how to read the Xrays correctly.  Wow.

So, in 39 years, I have had 5 fillings.  In 5 years at UDA, I have been prescribed 20 fillings?  This sounds like malpractice. I'm done.","3","1","2","2","3","3","2","2","3","3"

We started the night on the patio where we had a couple of speciality beers and some wings (which were the best wings I have had in a long time) Our hostess was great, she got us a nice table on the patio and our server was very good too, friendly and fast. After we went inside into the main bar (the entertainment switches back in forth between a DJ and a live band).

The patio was great for people watching the crowd is a mix of 20 somethings to people in their 50's.  Overall I found the prices very reasonable for downtown, the staff very good and the crowd was nice too. This is a great place to spend an evening with a date or some good friends.

I was very wrong there.  The technicians thought nothing of speaking what medication you have ordered (while waiting 10 minutes I heard others pick up their birth control, Zoloft, antibiotic and steroid.  There's absolutely no respect given to the customers.  I was happy to switch to mail order and not step in there.

Service in the store is hit or miss as another reviewer said.  I can have some very kind staff.  I can also be moving around an employee to grab my item without them bothering to move.

"_HllgJ9hI2WG2F1DQhdZZQ","Avenue Club and the Bubble Up Bar","Dinner on a Wed night with my family. First time to try this restaurant and looking forward to it, as we generally are fond of the Food Fight restaurants.  Overall quite disappointed, mostly based on the food quality and price.  I had the short rib stroganoff, my husband had the pan seared walleye, and my son had a cheeseburger.  Almost everything was pretty blah and seemed devoid of spices, salt, anything.  My husband said his walleye was ""OK"" but not worth the $20 tab.  My stroganoff was OK at best (as mentioned very bland and I needed to add lots of salt/pepper) and definitely overpriced (at $20) for a bowl of pasta, peas, mushrooms and one little tiny piece of short rib.  I don't mind spending $20 for an entrée that is tasty but this was definitely not it.  My son ordered his burger medium-well - it was way overcooked and extremely dry, and the coleslaw was also extremely bland. Again, I don't mind paying $11 for a good burger or sandwich but this was not worth it.  I will say that our server was nice and relatively attentive.  The décor is not my up my alley but was attractive and comfortable. However, based on the disappointing food, especially for the price, probably won't go back except maybe to have drinks at the bar or if I hear they've made some significant improvements.","1","2","2","1","2","3","3","3","3","3"

Actually, I'm glad this place survived because it is one of my favorite neighborhood gyro places.  That says something about the food, because JT Gyros was surrounded by construction tape and closed stores and still people found it.  The center also looks great now that the renovation is complete.

Anyway, about the food: The Vegetarian Plate is my personal favorite and I'm not a vegetarian!  It comes with dolmas (rice stuffed grape leaves), falafel, baba ghanoush, hummus, tomatoes, and a pita bread that is not fried. Sometimes I substitute for the pita used on the gyros because it is so good.  Also, the owner is really nice and he is always there workin' hard- and he always remembers me.  I say go and try this place if only to help support a local business. In a final note, the restaurant is always very clean and tidy.

Over the summer, my transmission went out and the previous management team performed the work. They gave me a three year warranty on the transmission. Unfortunately, I had to return my vehicle last week due to what I thought was the same problem.

Once my vehicle was ready, Ruben was there (over the weekend) to explain what had transpired. He apologized because the previous management team made a mistake in repairing my car. Long story short, they owned up to the mistake, apologized, and corrected it.

It's so refreshing to meet an honest owner at Purrfect Auto. His attitude and policies trickle down to management and the other staff and it shows.","3","3","2","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

They are incompetent and leaving people with urgent repairs for weeks. When I reported that there is a leak from the washing machine that might affect my neighbours downstairs they ignored it.

A couple of months later, the boiler was broken, as usual I phoned them and did not get any response for a week.When I called them again, they sent an engineer after next five working days. Then, I waited for landlord's permission to exchange the faulty part in the boiler.It took them 2.5 week to get it done. The heaters, in the corridor and the living room which were reported broken last year in December, and twice this year, are still not fixed. Now, It's almost 4 weeks that my washing machine is standing in the middle of the kitchen waiting for the exchange. The reporting process was the same as last time with the boiler.

The waiting area facilities (in the middle of the salon, pretty hectic rather than relaxing) and waiting experience (given a shot glass-sized dixie cup of tea rather than a large glass/mug of that delish stuff) are really the only things lacking... I think being on Mill/essentially on ASU campus might count for the differences as the typical customer isn't probably interested in those 'standards' that I have come to appreciate.  Also, every Aveda salon I've been to has nice bathrooms outfitted with their products.  The restroom facilities here were in the hallway and appeared to be shared with a few offices in the building (?). No nice products and pretty grungy looking IMO...

Now to the good stuff -my actual haircut: I requested Jessie per profile on the website and time availability.  She was GREAT!  Unlike some stylists that are either awkwardly silent or annoying gab-a-holics, Jessie has perfected that balance and was pretty funny to boot.  Also, of utmost importance, she actually cut my hair the way I wanted it.

Money-saving tip: check out their website if you're a first-time customer - you'll have several options of discounts.  I opted for the $40 haircut","1","2","3","2","1","3","2","1","3","2"

You're not training your dog to follow your commands; you're training them to eat cookies. Anyone could teach a dog that. You're better off getting a one on one trainer who actually cares about your dog's training.

I've wasted 4 weeks with classes here and my dog is actually worse than when he started. Now he won't respond to anything unless a treat is presented. I can't tell him to come to me unless he physically sees a treat in my hand. That's not the way to train a dog. They should respond to a call, not to a treat.

Dry, fishy-tasting salmon on a  boring bed of lettuce, and a grocery store-type roll with some type of disgusting spider web looking stuff on top of it.  The waitress figured out that the rolls were in a plastic bag too close to the heat and some of the plastic melted on the roll.  Why on earth would the cooks put that on a plate???

Food low-down:  Ribs - OK.  Pulled pork - dull.  Beer cheese soup - OK.  Salmon salad - Yucko.  Burger - OK.  So if the best I can say is ""OK""... that pretty much sums it up.

The service was really slow, but the waitress did notice we didn't eat much of the salmon salad so she comped us for it without us even asking - kudos to her for that.

In New Mexico, most restaurants will deep fry the relleno right before they bring it to the table, resulting in a very crispy tasty treat. I don't know why more places around here don't do that.","2","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","1","2"

We went during July of 2016 for a family celebration dinner. The rest of the family had chicken dishes and they said they were delicious.  Even my incredibly picky and spice phobic son found their chicken Tikka Masala was good. Not chicken mcnuggets but good.  My daughter really loved the Mango chicken.  They made up a special vegan jalfrezi for me and my wife had the chicken vindaloo.

Don't be afraid of it being too spicy.  They wouldn't have been in business this long if they didn't know how to cater to all pallets.  I actually thought mine was mild and they had to bring chili chutney.

The atmosphere is pleasant and the prices are fair.  A family dinner for four with tip and no alcohol but with lots of happy tummies was under only $80 as of this writing.  That is absolutely everything including the tip.","3","2","3","3","1","2","3","3","1","2"

They don't make doctors like this anymore. He's very thorough, explains everything, follows up with his patients, and shows a genuine care for each individual patient. I have referred him to friends and he has helped them tremendously as well.

We placed our order online then recieved a call from a Villa employee, she clarified what we wanted. We told her to pay special attention to our wing request because our order was wrong last time so please make sure correct...you reference it was wrong again. We also ordered a meatball sub online, listed under hot subs pretty clear cut...the employee verified we ordered a meatball parmigiano,  exactly what we ordered under subs, but what arrives is meatballs in a dish with red sauce and cheese. Don't worry folks she is new so that eliminates her from having any responsibility, or at least that is according to the manager who we spoke to over the phone. Manager clarified that if we are unhappy even though we just had them deliver the food we could personlly bring back our uneaten food to show her that it was wrong and THEN she can do something about it...an extremely generous offer but we already waited the typical 45+ minute wait for delivery on a Friday night so surprisingly our children were ready to eat whatever food arrived despite it being incorrect. Confused about why we should need to prove what we ordered was wrong? Thanks for being so disrespectful and uncaring to your ""valued"" customers Villa. I think we will take our business elsewhere in the future and no it is not because you delivered food wrong it is because you don't care that is happened!!!!!

A buffet would not be a buffet without Prime Rib. The Prime Rib here was ehh. It did not seem like the middle pieces had any sort of flavor. It was juicy but not tasty.

He said they took your kindness and he point out too me, the lens on the phone is big and when you lay the phone down it appears to be warped! And he told me Apple Store did not want to fix it due the fact they just want to keep your phone to fix it themselves so they can turn it around to sell it refurbished $350 and for you to buy another refurbished phone!

I received my beverage right away. It took a little while for my croissant. The croissant was a huge disappointment. It had only crumbles of bacon which were burned. The egg substitute was square and thick like a sponge. The cheese was also thick and yellow. I just couldn't imagine eating this so I threw away the majority of the sandwich.

Also, I sat in one of the brown chairs along the window.  I don't believe the insides of these chairs are ever cleaned.  While I was sitting in one of the chairs the young lady who was sweeping the floor used the same broom to sweep food out of a chair. I was horrified.

"PCV2WBICl01QYq7j4l_7Lw","Los Tacos","Los Tacos could be a fast food place to some but not to me. I consider places like Mickey D's and B-king to be fast food and the main reason is because most of their ""food"" is mechanically processed and frozen... and that's the definition of fast [unhealthy] food.

LT on the other hand does have a drive-thur but they are not fast and their food in my experience has always been very fresh. I usually get 2 chicken tacos that come in a corn tortilla which includes beans and I add avocado and skip the cheese. This little meal is about $7 and you can't go wrong with that.

I ordered this yesterday and I still had a 10 minute drive home and was wowed at the fact that when I got home my meal was still hot enough that I didn't need to reheat... Yay!

In a nutshell I like this LT location because they are faster than the one on Charleston near bruce and they've never miss up on my order. Hooray for Los Tacos all the way around!","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"
"nNMUNBK64PPd96c0_FjNhQ","Vdara Hotel","My stay at the Vdara was fantastic, it made the Las Vegas trip flow easily. The location is great, most of the places my group wanted to go were in walking distance.

I loved the non-smoking part the most, in a city where people can smoke everywhere it was nice to unwind in a clean environment. There is no casino inside, so you don't have to worry about crazy mobs of angry people down on their luck sloshing through the lobby just a relaxing place to sleep. They have a lot of little amenities and features that set it apart from other places I've stayed. They have automated black out curtains, the magazines laid out on the coffee table the large tub I didn't use and the amazing 24 hour room service. After a long night of gambling (losing all my money) and drinking (too much) it was nice to be able to come into my room at 3 in the morning and order a breakfast burrito and an ice cold Fat Tire Amber Ale. Also I have to mention the cafe downstairs that had the best turkey sandwich I've ever had in my life; roasted meat with aioli on cranberry bread.

The Aria casino next door is mind blowing too, all of the City Center is. They are under the MGM umbrella. The blackjack tables had 25 minimums, turns out that's not the best setting for a first time player, rookie mistake. But, I had fun and would do this again.","3","2","3","3","1","2","2","1","3","1"

I remember going on dinner cruises with different groups as well.  This is one of my favorite things to tell tourists to visit.

Having not been on a cruise in many years, I was excited to find out that Thursdays in the summer were university appreciation days.  This means that any student, faculty member, or anyone with a university ID can get a free ride for one of the hour-long sight-seeing cruises, day or evening.  As a way to get together before classes started, I invited about 10 friends, with only one originally from Pittsburgh, to go on an evening cruise with me.  We had a great time!

There were only about 4 other people on our cruise so we had full run of the ship, which was pretty neat.  We mostly hung out on the top deck because there was a guide on the top.  The guides on these cruises really know their stuff.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and only knew about 75% of the information provided to us.  Definitely informative and fun!  We loved doing the cruise at night, and we had great views of the Point!

We had so much fun on this cruise that we are looking at doing one of the Friday dinner cruises.  Some of the cruises are quite pricey and don't look too exciting so be sure to do your research.  Overall, it's a really fun way to spend an evening in Pittsburgh!","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

It was like they were put out by having to do their job or answer a simple question like where the soda fountain is.  I had a philly cheesesteak sandwich and my friend had pastrami/ sauerkraut in rye.  Both sandwiches were less than mediocre.  The rye bread for the pastrami was stale and seemed low quality.

The pub downstairs is inviting, and the restaurant is upstairs, though rather on the small side. After walking up to the castle and stopping at shops along the way, Deacon Brodie's Tavern offers a nice respite with a pint of your favorite brew. Upstairs, the restaurant can get crowded depending on what time you go, though if you're early enough you won't have a problem. And it's not just tourists: along with the group of septuagenarians in matching caps, there was a Scottish wedding party that came in - both of which added considerably to the wait time. I was fortunately already seated with a plate of fish and chips and a pint of Tennent's. Everything was good, though nothing was exceptional. The fish was crispy on the outside, flaky inside, though could have done with a dash of vinegar, which I had difficulty obtaining from the harried waitress.

In the end, the warm atmosphere and cozy, low-ceilinged space with all the traditional pints and dishes makes Deacon Brodie's a prime stop on the Royal Mile.","2","2","2","2","3","2","3","2","3","3"

Servers and staff are always accommodating and so sweet. Our server our past few visits is a kind Korean man who checked up on us frequently and was quick to get our orders, checks, and refills of water. Absolute turnaround from my first experience.

Dining area is pretty empty during lunch, which surprises me because the food is absolutely delicious. I've tried new dishes since my last review, such as the pork bokum, kimcheejiggae, jjambong, and fried dumplings. Pork bokum is delightfully spicy and flavorful, and it's been a favorite for my coworkers who are less familiar with Korean food. Kimcheejigae is a broth made from rice cakes, pork, and kimchee, and it's absolutely delicious. This one is more sour, spicy, and definitely more flavorful (so if you don't like the taste of kimchee, that is not for you). Jjambong is a noodle soup with seafood and another spicy broth. It's very tasty, but my favorite dish will forever be the ddukmanduguk.

New Seoul has become my new favorite lunch location. Service is attentive and quick, and food has been just amazing. I noticed that I miss my mother's home cooking when I dine here, which just shows me how delicious and authentic this Korean food is.","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","3"

My baby got beer, I ordered a Sangiovese and my friend a peach cocktail.

We began our culinary journey with the calamari and I enjoyed it because the sauce was fantastic and it was not too greasy or salty like some places choose to fry up their seafood. My friend ordered the bucatini amatriciana, my baby ordered the braised short ribs and I ordered veal marsala. We shared a bit of each others and they were all fantastic dishes especially mine. It is actually quite easy for one to ruin a good veal dish (chewy, rubbery, no flavor, etc). Then when it came time to satisfy our sweet tooth, my friend ordered the highly recommended Amaretto dessert and I shared the sliced chocolate ice cream with nuts and strawberries.

It was simple and flavorful... all of it... not too over the top by trying too hard. Thank you for a great culinary experience!","3","2","2","3","1","1","2","3","3","2"

I love that it carries so many local artists, gives me a good reason to throw my money at them :) They have everything from great jewelry, to clothing, soap, stationery, and more. If you are looking for a unique gift for someone, for sure check out Frances.

They also hold workshops here, I'd definitely recommend checking out their schedule and stopping by for one. I was lucky enough to attend TERRARIAN, a terrarium making class led by Ian and it was awesome. Not only did I make a bad ass terrarium, I also learned a lot about moss, mini ecosystems, and more.

I can't wait to go back to Frances to buy more goodies (i have my eye on a few tops and bracelets) and support local as well as check out some more workshops.

She was very bad at her job; we were in a group of 5 which seemed to overwhelm her. After we placed our orders I realized I forgot a detail I wanted added to our burger, when I called ""Trish"" over she seemed very displeased that she had to ""find her manager and change the order"" which shouldn't be that big of a deal, coming from someone who works in a restaurant. Then after she did that she came back and informed the whole table ""because I had to change HIS order, the rest of your food will be delayed 10/15 minutes"". Which was not great to hear, but it didn't really work out that way anyways. My burger wasn't that great, the grilled onions were cut too large and it was just all around an average burger. Then when it came to checking out, it took way too long. What should've been an hour meal took two hours. The only good thing about it was the free cookies. Poor service by Trish made it a pretty crappy experience.","2","1","2","1","2","3","1","2","2","2"

A wide variety of pasties are offered with us deciding to share one filled with lamb, mint, potatoes, rutabaga, and onion that was accompanied by a side of red wine gravy.

This time for sure I made it my first lunch stop in Vegas. Flawless lunch service from start to finish with everything made to flow so effortlessly. It was a quiet, relaxing and enjoyable lunch.

My eyes was always on the Croque Madame. That mornay sauce definitely makes this dish. I only wished my dish had more of that sauce. The frites were good but I still prefer the Golden Arches one more. (Hope I didn't make you cringe?) I was also expecting the Croque Madame to be bigger than it actually was & less frites would've been perfect. It looked like they used two whole potatoes. It was a lot. If there's ever a next time I'll ask for a salad instead.

Overall glad I finally got to cross it off my bookmark. And it only took me a dozen years to do it. Hooray!","1","2","2","1","2","3","1","2","3","2"

When I came (no reservations) I had about a 20 minute wait for a table of two - which I didn't mind and took this time to order from the bar. The bartender was friendly and quick. With a drink in hand, it was a pleasure to check out the wines and the milieu of this place of business. It's quite nice, it is however not very big and it can get quite loud in here. Not too loud for a simple conversation, but loud enough for me to take notice.

Once seated the service was great. Our server was a knowledgeable and energetic gentleman that gladly helped out in any decision making regarding the menu. I tried their beer selection as well as had a cheese tray. Note: For being a wine place, they sure do take pride in their beer selection - however I must say that I was not impressed by their cheese. They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.

The service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be.

I had to drench the steak into a1 sauce and salt to get any flavor out of it. However, the meat was very tender which made up for it. Personally, i think eating at texas de brazil is a LOT better.

I can only assume that the staff is pressured to hit very aggressive sales targets on the cosmetics and skincare products as I would be inundated with questions about my skincare regime and recommendations.  When I declined or said that I was not interested, they would even insult my appearance and when I would return the next time they would compliment me on the same things that they were criticizing previously.

We ordered 2 rice bowls and 1 udon entree.  They all looked beautiful.  There were more varieties of toppings than other Japanese rice and noodle restaurants of the same price range.  I had a rice bowl, and the portion was alright for the price ($8.50).  I suspect it might be insufficient for a man of average appetite.  The toppings were nicely done.  The rice was not.  I didn't like the flavour of the mayo sauce, so it negatively impacted my opinion of the rice a lot.

There were two other off things.  There was no heat in the restaurant.  The outside temperature was under 10C.  It was cool in the restaurant.  Secondly, the waitress never refilled our water cups.

The steak thing was absolutely the most horrible tasting whatever it is ingredient laden swill to come out of an oven I have ever tasted. To sum it up I was so starved after waiting an hour to get it that I forced down the sub, but the other thing ended up in the garbage.

We've had season tickets here for 6 years now and one year, they even had a winning season.  The seats are cold and can be pretty crowded if you don't pony up the money to get seat cushions installed.  As season tickets are so low, it isn't that bad of a deal.

Parking can be plentiful if you make a donation to the I Fund, then you get parking passes at a designated lots.  This also helps the Athletic department and gets you emails with offers to other events before they go on sale to the general public.

I would say that the drinks are better than the food, but that's just based on what I've had to eat there.  If you like modern cuisine, this place is for you!

First of all, the restaurant at dusk/dinner is very dim, so break out those reading glasses. Their wine list is amazing!  I would recommend the antipasti plate for an appetizer because it's the bomb.com. Be sure to get the awesome garlic and mushrooms with the antipasti plate. The house salad was one of the best I've had in a while, especially with the dressing on the side.  The squash tortelli was a little heavy on the squash.

I never felt rushed to choose. He brought out a couple of different cycles for me to test ride. I even tried out a cruiser that I knew I wasn't going to purchase, just for fun. Once I settled on what I wanted the rest was quick and painless. He even helped me load the damn thing into my vehicle without asking if I needed help. (I did) *mental note... purchase a trunk rack*

I came in about a week or so later to buy some lights and he remembered me and even gave me a discount because I had made the purchase such a short time prior. I will certainly continue to give Landis my business.....and I will certainly continue to give names to objects.

One office just wanted to charge you out the wazoo for unnecessary tests and treatment and the other in my opinion was just careless and didn't want to be bothered with less than calm pets.

So I came upon Bethany because this was the hospital that the pet rescue where I got my new dog used. Bethany is not some fancy, upscale office and I'm pretty sure that's why their pricing is reasonable.  Even when they ran a blood panel for my dog it seemed to cost about $300 less than the blood panel they did for my cat at Arrow.

I have to drive aways to get to Bethany and they don't have weekend hours (not sure what's up with AZ vets not having weekend hours - this is the norm back east) but I do have fall back vets if something happens on the weekend.

We started off with some $1 oysters (happy hour special) and some Onion soup. The soup actually used the lion crocks that you see in Paris, and it had just the right amount of wine in the broth. It was among the best we've ever tried. My main course was a bison bourginon. I've never had braised bison, but this dish will make me want to make it at home. The meat was tender and flavorful. The pearl onions were caramelized, yet retained a soft and satisfying crunch. My only concern was that it was undersalted, but this was an easy fix with a twist of the salt grinder. My wife had the chicken, which is a half-bird cooked all-at-once (rather than partially cooked and reheated). It was juicy, well-seasoned, and served with mashed potatoes and a truffle sauce.  We skipped out on dessert because we had our fill.

The ambiance was perfect, with cafe-style tables outside, a mid-20th century Parisian decor inside, and Yves Montand playing softly over the speakers. Our server was friendly, genuine, and transparent when it came to describing the dishes. She made us feel welcome, comfortable, and appreciated. The rest of the staff were warm and inviting as well.

Being a huge fan of the other Vig locations, I knew that this new one wouldn't disappoint. And what do you know? I. Was. Right.

The vibe is very chill and relaxed with low lighting both inside and outside. I've checked out the inside, but only sat outside so far because the weather is starting to feel like fall here in the valley. It has almost like a rustic vibe with these dark wood tones but then they incorporated metal and clean lines in their design for a modern touch. They have crisp green grass outside, which is always great in Phoenix, and it fits the Roosevelt Row feel by being an old home converted into the restaurant. Tons of trees hover around you and it's just a really neat, cozy, yet open space.

While we waited for a table, we were approached by a waiter right away to help us with drinks. Our actual waiter was also very helpful, fast to introduce himself and take care of us, and overall really great. The food is similar to the other Vig locations and it's just as delicious.

Chimney cone - 3.5 stars reminds me of churros. Prefer it to be a little warmer. There is a chocolate ball in the bottom to prevent the ice cream from dripping everywhere. Unfortunately, there was a crack in my cone and the ice cream oozed out of there.

Ice cream -2 stars. Nothing really special about the ice cream. Tiramisu was basically just vanilla ice cream with the coco powder on top and a couple small pieces of tiramisu cake in the middle. The berry one just tasted like chocolate ice cream with some berries in the middle.

The night we went to Velvet, we had left 751 for being too much of a sweaty sauna and wanted to go somewhere with no cover. Success. Inside, we found a strange mix of wannabe goths and Richmond Street rejects. I spent most of the night taking pictures of this one guy who had the most ridiculous methods of trying to get close to girls. Revolting.

Would you like to spend your time making a reservation for 2 at 6:30pm only to have to sit shoulder to shoulder with another couple? It was so awkward having the hostess take us to our ""table"" to find that it was between two couples sitting across from each other. Booth? No. it's a picnic table and the only way you get to sit is across from each other. The middle party also has to ask either of the other strangers at the table for silverware, napkins, and the selection of sauces. It really shows the greed and utter disconnect with the general public when you spend the time to call in ahead and get a seat literally (not figuratively) between 2 other couples who are forced to sit across a table. The waitress ""Deb or Debbie? Was amazing"" and the food was over priced but good for downtown, but really the seating arrangements and greed by the owners was disappointing. If you prefer to even have enough space to have a conversation I would definitely avoid this place. The seating is a disaster. Even with a reservation, they reward you by seating in the same place. Imagine a high school lunch table and literally having to sit shoulder to shoulder with a stranger. So awkward. The food and service were awesome though.","1","1","2","1","3","2","1","3","2","2"

The Great Burrito Bifurcation of Let's Call It 2009 let the area with two chains where once there was one. Of the two, I'd have to say Burrito Bandidos beats out the Boyz. Why, you ask? The location certainly isn't it - cramped at the best of times during the day, it's downright insane at night. The expanded selection of meats certainly helps - sometimes you just want some pulled pork or a chicken-steak blend. But overall I do find that the Bandidos are a notch above the Boyz on Adelaide in terms of overall taste.

I find service to usually be friendly, but slow. Call ahead for group orders or later at night - saves time, especially on clubbing' nights.

Price-wise, you're looking at 8 to 10 per person, more depending on size and meat selection.","2","1","3","2","2","3","3","3","2","3"

He went to a bridal show Bamboo Bakery hosted and in addition we had a private cake tasting session.  I joined for the private cake tasting session and surprisingly the cake tastes deliciously moist and not-too-sweet, just how I like it. The decision for us to go with Bamboo Bakery was not a difficult one for us at all.  David sketched a draft of our cake and it was exactly what we wanted...we were in awe of his free-hand sketching...speaks volume to his experience and professionalism.  We took my sister and nephews along to help vote on two different flavors of cake because there were quite a few for us to choose from.  The whole experience was a breeze and it was probably the quickest process in our whole wedding planning because David walked us through the whole process and made it painlessly sweet. Our cake was beautiful, tastes spectacular and the price was very very reasonable.  Our guests loved the cake and we couldn't wait to get our wedding photos to complete this review.

During my most recent visit my group ordered golden tofu with chili sauce, coconut milk cakes (dim sum), water spinach, cashew tofu, and chicken lo mein.

There was 4 guys working literally the whole night cracking them open.  Some of the people at the restaurant were taking twenty at a time it seemed, which was kind of ridiculous, consider the time it was taking to open each one.  It seemed every time they put oysters out, it would need immediate replacement.

The staff was friendly, the double queen room with microwave and fridge was nice and big, and the cleanliness was good. Without question this hotel had the best free breakfast of all the places we stayed on a long road trip.

The layout of the breakfast self-serve area was the best, as was the size of the breakfast room and the layout of the tables. The hot food offerings were the best here (my husband was over the moon for the biscuits and gravy) as were the rest of the breakfast offerings. We are big on getting a nice filling hot breakfast before hitting the road and if we're going this way again we'd stay here without question.

Note: We didn't need to go into Vegas itself - in fact we were avoiding it because of our preschooler, so if that's your goal this place is pretty darn far from the action.

I couldn't give five stars though because as other reviewers pointed out, the area around this hotel makes you feel icky. Luckily, we didn't need to go out at night (as most people vacationing in this area would). Also, our first night spent here (a Friday night) there was a booming sound all night that we still haven't figured out.

I really enjoyed my experience here. :-D The place is tight, with traditional decor, reminiscent of many Asian restaurants in Korea, China, and Japan. The wait time can be up to 30-45 minutes though. But I thought it was worth the wait time (though I doubt I'd say the same during winter, where it feel likes time has stopped because it's so cold).

I had the bibimbap with chicken, and one of the soups. The soup was nice, but the bibimbap was a bit overpriced, but maybe properly priced in the Montreal marketplace, as I have not seen bibimbap charged less than 10 bucks in restaurants there (you can find something similar for may 6-8 bucks in Toronto and New York).

The Yuzu carbonated juice was very refreshing. It reminded me of my childhood when I was visiting one of the buddhist temples in Korea. The monks and my family, while talking, were sipping on tea with the yuzu fruit slices, used for sweetening. That was a very nice trip back to memory lane. :-)

I bought a wide range of items, from raw stone bulk packages to premade pendants, and I was overall very impressed by the quality for the price. The bulk stones were a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and color variation where appropriate. Overall the most hit-or-miss thing was probably the agate. I ordered 9 small ones with drilled holes and two larger ones with plates edges and double connectors. A couple of the smaller pieces were completely beautiful, whereas others had virtually no variation in color or transparency. Unfortunately one of the bigger ones I bought was the low-variation type, and also had some major pitting.

Overall, though, the items were great! With the large number of items I bought and the relatively low prices compared to other retailers available online, a few less-beautiful stones are totally acceptable, and nothing was damaged or incorrect at all. I'll definitely shop with them again!","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"

My girls and I got lucky by meeting some people that had a VIP cabana with the private pools off to the sides. The servers at the cabana was extremely attentive - she kept on getting us drinks and mixing shots for us.

The guy advised unless I drive a lot I didn't need the more expensive tinting. He even advised if I had a smart phone to go on yelp and they had a 20.00 discount. I set my appointment and was running late, I called and they thanked me for letting them know I was running late. When we arrived at Eco-Tint they greeted us and were friendly and advised how long it would take to do the tint. I waited to do this review to check the quality of their work. I am very happy with the work that was done and it was well worth the money we spent. The place we called before that did my husbands car quoted me one price and him another for the same car and work so I was happy they did that because I made me look else where, if you compare the tint on my husbands car to mine they are both good tint jobs but with Eco-tint they actually tint all the way to the edge of the window. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for quality tint and they have amazing customer service.","1","2","2","1","2","3","3","1","3","3"

It was super nice of him, as we were about to just walk away.

I ordered the Turtle Latte ($4.50), which was a cold mix of peanut butter, chocolate, caramel, and espresso.  As others have said, this drink is almost like a milkshake but not overpoweringly sweet.  The barista told us this was one of the first drinks he invented when Delanie's started, which was a fun tidbit.  I really enjoyed this drink, and I have never had anything else quite like it.

The shop is really big, but a few more tables would be nice.  We did manage to get a seat; however most everyone was sharing tables.

She kept repeating how expensive her glue was and that she did everything correctly as she was certified. I'm convinced she used inferior glue and lashes.

I opted for a table. I came shortly before the lunch hour when it was not too crowded and was able to be served right away.  They serve breakfast all day and have a full service bar close to the entrance. I opted to try lunch so I ordered a chicken sandwich which comes with your choice of either french fries, coleslaw, or small salad. I went with the coleslaw. I had my meal served on a lined pie plate. The sandwich came with arugula, oven roasted tomato, and bacon. My waitress told me that unless I wanted it there was no need for me to put a condiment on it. The chicken was full of flavor and the bacon was so crisp! I enjoyed every bite of it.

The coleslaw had cranberries and a cream sauce that added a bit of sweetness to it. Not only that my lunch was very reasonably priced. The restaurant is set up with metal chairs all around and by the time I left this place was packed!

I certainly plan to return and try out a breakfast since my waitress explained to me that one of the more popular items was the pan seared gulf shrimp with cream cheddar grits, and sunny side egg.

Overall, we said: ""I enjoyed the food in Zest very much. For £7.95, this was a well-executed and filling lunch. Even the filter coffee to round things off was pretty decent. The whole place could use a big squeeze of the zesty goodness that the name of the place implies, though, as it's slightly in the ""solid and reliable"" mould, at the moment, rather than offering something bold and fresh.""","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3"

Every single lady had loads of tattoos and one had facial piercings.  Not bein' judgey, just painting a picture for you.

Our stylist was an older lady with that raspy ""I-been-smokin'-for-37-years"" type of voice and I'm pretty sure she might be on parole.  I did not have high hopes when she spent 10 minutes trying to get her clippers to work.

I gotta admit the haircut was pretty good and less than 20 bucks.  These gals know what they are doing.

We waited about 30min for 2 people for breakfast on a Saturday and it was worth it...it's probably wise to have someone from your party hop out and put your name on the list while you're circling the lot!

Okay on to the food...I had a basic breakfast with grits, hash browns, sausage and a biscuit. Of course I didn't finish it all because they definitely give you diner sized portions but it was solid.

I am a foodie, and I have no trouble paying for good food, but the Carbon Bar did not deliver. The scallop appetizer ($14) came with one scallop sliced into three. It was super thin and disappointing. The Crabcake & BC Shrimp, for $29, included one slightly more than average sized Crabcake with a table spoon of avocado and three tiny baby shrimp. Mostly breadcrumbs, this dish is way overpriced. Their Pork Ribs, while admittedly fall-off-the-bone tender, were lacking in flavor and only included 4 avg sized ribs for $19.

The pizza was fresh out to a brick pizza oven and looked like a medium pizza that was cut in half.  The cheese was perfectly melted and the pepperoni delicious.  The pizza crust was nice and crisp on the bottom so that you can hold the slice and eat without having it droop and fall on the plate.

There was another server (manager?) that seemed hell bent on interacting with me, however, despite my strategic use of my cell phone.

When I didn't laugh, he told it to an older gentleman sitting next to me, repeating it again until he was finally humored with a chuckle.

It's a shame, because the station is easy to get into if you can get there, the pumps work well, and their prices are usually among the best in town. If you happen by at night, they are very well lit - almost too much so - those lights can blind you.","1","3","3","3","3","2","1","2","2","2"

Open bar, great set-up, nice decor, friendly bartenders, big open space, good music, what more can someone ask for?

Surrender ROCKED. We had the best time ever. We partied way into the early morning and danced like we never danced before. We found a nice area outside by the pool where we were able to stash our stuff and even sit when we needed a break. The cute cocktail waitresses came around with the pre-made shots which were very tasty. The dj played great music and there were plenty of places to go if you wanted to leave the main dance floor when it got to crowded.

It was my baby cousin's 21st birthday and she had a blast and we all did too. Luckily we were on a list so we didn't have to wait to long. I would definitely check out Surrender again the next time I'm in Vegas.","3","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3"

I instantly purchased a sleeve in hopes of stretching out the moment and finished them all in the same day (six cookies).

"xjBF_F_0PrbvgcmXSUbw2A","Arizona Mattress Overstock","I read reviews about how great Arizona Mattress Overstock was, so let me add this disclaimer that I give it 3 stars in comparison to what I thought would be fantastic.

We went looking for a king mattress and box spring set and saw this place had killer deals. When we got there you could not tell the deals from the non-deals and the guy had to keep calling his manager to find out if a mattress was part of a sale. It left me feeling that if you didn't know about the sale you wouldn't get the sale price. I also noticed the mattresses had a retail price listed, which was incredibly high in comparison to any retail price I Googled for that particular mattress. It's a way of making people feel they are getting a better bang for their buck.

Also a lot of what is overstock is last year's inventory but still trying to sell at this year's prices. Many of the mattresses, even though in plastic, had scuff marks or were dirty, which left me feeling that some mattresses may be slightly used - a huge turn off for me. The gentlemen also didn't have the right box springs to support the mattress, for the size or the brand.

Although we found a mattress we liked, I wasn't sold on buying anything from this store and chose to buy from another retailer store. While yes, I did pay more, I at least felt confident in my purchase. If I'm going to be dropping $1500 on a mattress I want to feel secure in that purchase and Arizona Mattress Overstock just didn't do that for me.","3","2","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3"

Despite being a Saturday, the restaurant didn't seem packed, so the wait was unacceptable. Our server, while nice, never stopped to say, ""sorry about the wait"" or ""your food should be out in a few minutes.""  My husband got the farm burger. He was pleased. I got the Caesar salad and the gooey fries. The gooey fries had definitely been sitting out because they were not hot and the cheese no longer gooey. Big disappointment. My Caesar was good, but not exceptional for Gordon Ramsey. Overall, negative for the long wait and prices and positive for  while the atmosphere and kind servers.

Or go and take a Zocor or Lipitor and come back to this post.  As I was saying, the crispy skin and the lightly juicy fatty meat was balanced very well.  The flavor was very nice and I knew I wasn't eating Sam Woo's roast pork.  It different, it didn't have the Sam Woo flavor.  It had it's own distinct flavor that was equally as good.  And I was so happy it wasn't Sam Woo.  In the Asian population, everyone knows that Sam Woo has the best BBQ in town.

Two weeks after Christmas, I went back to order 2 lbs of roast pork for dinner.  The roast pork was consistent and still tasted just as good.  A week later the hubby and I went there for dinner and their duck noodle soup did not disappoint.  Oh yeah, I'm total fan of this place.  It's cheap and food is good and hearty.   Like most Chinese dives, they take cash only and you can communicate with them in English but if you speak a little Chinese here it goes a long way....

Although many plants are not in season (I visited in January, many plants were in hibernation), the botanical gardens, per my interpretation, are designed as series of walking paths that capture natures essence from various perspectives.

The hardest part about this place is getting there - you have to be in the right lane or go around the block - turning left into here is just not going to happen at lunch time. Plan your route accordingly to avoid unnecessary stress.

The place is laid out nicely with a variety of seating options. We chose a picnic table near the window. Instantly a basket of mini corn bread muffins and butter were brought out to us - a very fun surprise! A waitress took our order and although they had $2 bottles of beer on special we decided to go the soda route. Lots of napkins were also brought out. Two types of sauce are on the table (regular and spicy).

Our order of the burnt ends came out in no time. At $8.50 it included a huge portion, a choice of side, buttered toast points, and a cornbread muffin. I chose fries as my side - they reminded me a lot of steak 'n' shake fries if any else remembers those as well! The spicy sauce was not very spicy but they seem to have an endless assortment of sauces available if you ask - I should have asked! The meat was not exactly what I would associate with burnt ends but it was tasty all the same!

I pointed out that the shellac polish on my nails was dark on my pinky nail and mostly sheer on my thumb and all of my second hand.  The least I expect is all my nails to look the same.  I asked him if he thought it looked good and he said, ""I take off for you"", then leaves me sitting there for 30 minutes while he does another persons nails.  He never came back or apologized for leaving me sitting there all of that time.  Another guy started taking off my nail polish and said that it takes a long time to take shellac off so I need to make sure I like the color next time.  I LOVED the color, but it was only that color on ONE OF MY NAILS.  He then began to quickly slap on the shellac and literally throw my hands under the UV light.  Although the color was uniform with this polish, it was VERY POORLY applied and I'm still picking nail polish from under my nails and off the skin on the side of my nails.

Non apologetic and an ""oh well...."" attitude.  Called them for toilet paper, tissues, towels...and only once did they deliver, usually I had to go get it.  I was supposed to stay for 90 days, but had enough. Time to try another hotel as they don't seem to want to fix the issues.

On the plus,  the breakfast and breakfast staff are spot on.  Friendly and good service.  Always treated with a smile and hello.

The place is equipped with tons of seating and I found the service to be quite great compared to some of their competition. In fact, we pretty much never had to flag down our waitress for anything.

One thing - I wish they had a greater selection in their soondubu varieties. I'd love to get a soondubu with vegetables or soondubu with mushroom without having to make a specific request each time.

I ordered Rare beef Pho and it was great, the broth was fresh and full of flavor, the meat was the most tender beef I have ever had in pho and there was a generous helping of beef and noodles.  We had the calamari appetizer and my mom ordered the Crisp and Crunch Rolls AMAZING shrimp tempura, sweet potato, wild berry cream cheese so good I may go back tonight and order it for take home.

The restaurant--particularly the tables towards the back (and, I would imagine, the patio, though it was closed at the time)--also features a spectacular view of the Wynn Golf Course's 18th green and waterfall.

The Field Green Salad was very good, with large, fresh, crunchy greens covered in a relatively subtle vinaigrette.  I also very much liked the bread--the olive roll and (especially) the multi-grain roll more than pulled their weight as lunch accompaniments.  I was less enthused with the Shrimp and Grits.  At least in my opinion, the shrimp should be fully de-shelled.  The sauce provided a little bit of spice, but the grits themselves seemed overcooked or over-processed.  The dish as a whole seemed a bit removed from the Southern classic.","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","3","3","3"

In line, they check your id's first and then you're free to go to another line and order.  You can try as many flavors as you like. I ended up sharing a monster yard with two of my girl friends and it costed about $18 ish?

PEACH BELLINI:  This is what we ended up picking.  It's basically a peach slushy with rum and champagne, but I can't taste the alcohol...so it's perfect LOL!  I would totally get this again!

190 OCTANE:  This was their most popular, so we decided to try it.  OMG it is way too strong.  Had a sip of it and we all definitely could not survive a yard of it even sharing.  Tastes straight up like hard liquor haha. If you're into get buzzed/drunk in the day, this is all for you.  I'll pass on this because I'm all about that g(randma) life hahah!

"Q-5uthojAHEEJOP-rkTqeg","Greenberg's Deli","[FOOD]: Finding quality, cheap eats in Vegas was impossible to find until I stumbled upon Greenberg's Deli located in NY/NY's boulevard of restaurants. The deli is set-up like an assembly line so do not worry if the line looks long - it moves very quickly. Luckily, I came in at a non-peak time (~3PM) so I was in and out within 5 minutes. I ordered the Vinnie's Deluxe sandwich which was enough to fill me for lunch and dinner. It consisted of their famous pastrami, corned beef, and turkey. All the meats are sliced freshly for you when you order, and you have choice of bread (highly recommend their rye). The sandwich was extremely flavorful and competes well with any of the top delicatessens in New York. The sandwich only comes with mayo, so I recommend adding in some complimentary mustard to give it an extra kick.

[SERVICE]: Self-seating, traditional delicatessen-esque so no real service. Staff was friendly and gave me great recommendations on how to maximize the flavor of the meats!

[ATMOSPHERE]: Spacious deli with plenty of space for customers to slide trays down the assembly line. The restaurant really tried to replicate the feel of their other restaurants despite not having a true dining area (only a few tables located within the deli, but plenty of seating outside).

[TIPS]: COME HERE INSTEAD OF EARL OF SANDWICH. It's worth the extra $3 and you'll be 2x as full. Go between 2-4PM to avoid the line. If you're not that hungry, the sandwich will be too much for you, so split with a friend :)","3","2","1","2","3","3","3","2","3","3"
"t8Z8KfDIv65TTfAUm68YBg","Celebrity Theatre","Celebrity brings some pretty diverse acts into Phoenix.  I often hear about acts only after I've missed them because these aren't folks who are being promoted to the gills by their record companies.  You might have a week filled with Lyle Lovett, a mariachi festival, Cyndi Lauper and D.L. Hugely.  Jazz, funk, Tejano, R&B, Gospel, Punk, Classic Rock and comedy.  You name it - it plays it.

This is one of those places where it's actually true that there isn't a bad seat in the house.  BUT - it's important to know that some shows will not play in the round, and some will actually use a backdrop.  I've even been to a show where they roped off part of the seating so we could only sit in one area.  I've only been to a few shows here that were open seating - most of them have been reserved.  Though a few of those were only assigned by price - inner level one price, outer level was another price.

This is an older theater and seats are kinda tight - but it's not too bad.  Just plan to get cozy with your neighbor.  The other cool thing about the place is that there is a little bar/nightclub feeling in the area outside the lobby area.  Full bars, often some good music playing.  Folks often getting a bit more social.

Final note - you  know how when you see a comedian you shouldn't sit in the front row?  Well, we Celebrity you shouldn't sit in the first 5 rows.  You are RIGHT THERE and they can see you far too clearly.","2","3","1","2","3","2","2","3","3","3"

I went there for my party, and invited about 10 friends to come bowl with me. The pricing was pretty legitimate, and they still have new shoes and shiny new lanes. We went at 5pm and it was EMPTY. They said they had a big lunch rush, but I'm sure things are still picking up here. Everyone in my party got served on time and with appropriate happy hour orders, but I had my order screwed up a few times. And there were drinks that were brought out that no one had, and some of the servers (I think we had 5?) were confused. HOWEVER, I know that they're still learning, and that they're working out the kinks on their food and their service. I guess I just expected a lot more pretty early in their lifespan.

The ribs were really good and the brisket was decent.  It was the flat and was cut thin, probably because it was a touch dry.  It had a good flavor though.

The second time was this month (July 2014) and I got the brisket platter with two sides.  The baked beans were decent.  Nothing special, but tasted fine.  The Mac-n-cheese was pretty good.  There was a lot of cheese sauce in relation to macaroni.  I like a little crunch to my mac and cheese, but this was thick and creamy, which is OK.  The brisket was great.  It wasn't cut paper thin, had a nice smoke ring and was easily pulled apart with fingers.  In other words it was tender and not dry at all.  Much better than the first time I visited.  My only complaint would be they put sauce on the brisket.  I prefer sauce on the side because good barbeque doesn't need sauce and this brisket didn't need sauce.","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3"
"IYshAjRe6noD7DRTOlJ16w","We Seal It Desert Proofing Specialists","I saw this service on a local real estate show and decided to try it.  Bought my home in north Phoenix about 3 years ago.  The first year was ok, but the second year I began seeing scorpions inside my home.  The number escalated until I was killing one or more every week.  They were in every room and I couldn't figure out how they were getting inside.  I've been using a reliable exterminator every month for the past 3 years, but any good exterminator will tell you that spraying for scorpions does not work unless you spray the poison directly on them.  So, I had to try something else.

I had my home and garage sealed 2 weeks ago and what a difference!  They were very thorough, caulking every exterior crack, putting in new weather stripping, adjusting doors, etc.  Took about 6 hours to do the whole house.  My car stays cleaner in the garage since there's less dust blowing in.  I haven't seen a single scorpion inside my home (or the bugs they like to eat) since my home was sealed.  I'm hoping my electricity bill goes down now that I'm not letting all the cool air leak out.  Very affordable service, especially if you put a high value on peace of mind!

David, the owner, did make it clear that the warranty is not transferable.  Am sorry the sellers did not make that clear when the person who wrote the negative review complained that David wasn't willing to work for free.

I get my hair done next door to Rivas, and there's always at least one stylist eating nachos or a burrito and it's not unusual for the whole store to erupt in arguing over favorite dishes.

The consensus seems to be that the fajitas are the best choice but you can't really go wrong. Their chile relleno is one of the best I've had and their burritos are packed with protein. Ask what's in them though, because the shrimp just comes with pico and guac (and a TON of shrimp!), and I opted to add spinach to fill it out. The enchiladas get really mixed reviews though.

Rivas is a counter service place with very limited seating. Don't leave without hitting up the salsa bar- selection is limited but the red is mild and the green is good for more kick.","2","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","2"

Anyway, we were seated and placed our orders. I got the Monte Cristo, which was absolutely amazing and gigantic, which I knew it would be. Our waiter was really great and prompt.

Considering that this couldn't fill up an infant, we also ordered the pretzel and California roll. The pretzel was overcooked and very hard, and the accompanying cheese sauce was grainy, and tasted very poor.

The groceries here are sometimes cheaper than other locations, and certainly well-stocked with food you probably should eat less of (snacks and ice cream, noticeably), although partially to cater to the student population, I think.

They had a few guest beers on the back,  but as far as their self made selections go the list was rather limited.  I had a pilsner,  which was good for the plainer beer it is, but I'd like to see some more creativity with their lighter brews.

If you stop in I would implore you to order the charcuterie items. The selection of cheeses and side items are vast,  with a lot of complex flavors. On my board I had raspberry infused chocolate pieces, perfectly acidic pickles, and sumptuously fatty Jamon... And that's not even mentioning the cheeses! Their blue cheese ""smokey blue"" is so soft and buttery,  it plays perfectly with the cheeses sharp flavors. Their was another cheese... Goose something... that was my favorite.

You can see their posts here are a sort of damage control, but none of them apologize for any confusion or what may have happen and are entirely defensive.  Expect the same when you get screwed.","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","3","2","3"

I have been in several times and have had great expirences.  One time the lady doing my massage got confused on what package I had and gave me a shorter massage than what it was supposed to be, when she realized the error (I was already in getting my facial) she let the manager know what happened and they made sure to take care of me.

Why does Walmart expect me to leave my child outside while I do any shopping that Walmart might decide is ""inappropriate""  if my son is in tow.

I asked to speak to a manager, he came over, didn't even inquire about how me and my son are related just said ""he needs ID"" !!??!!

My favorite dish is the chicken (or lamb) vindaloo and they will make it super spicy, which is how I like it. There has been only one time where I have had leftovers for the next day-- that's how scrumptious it is. Make it the dinner portion and you receive a naan bread and rice for a nominal extra fee. My wife tends to go for the channa masala, which she always thoroughly enjoys. We usually share the papadum with mango chutney to start (do not miss it) and share an order of the spinach cheese dish (can't remember the name). Everything is phenomenal and the staff is wonderful. They are there when you need them but they do not hover, which I appreciate. But they are super friendly and if you want to have a conversation, they're great. The positive in my opinion of this place is that there are usually not many people here dining (mostly Indian though, so you know this is the real deal) so we have the place relatively to ourselves-- but I want the place to stay in business so please, eat here and give them your business! Of all the Indian places I've eaten at in this town-- and in others-- this one is one of the very few deserving of 5 stars.

There's tons of options on cheaply made disposable furniture(It's not the stuff you make an investment in and pass it down to your kids), and a huge selection of inexpensive household goods, but it's of somewhat low quality and the store is gargantuan. It's nice to see the ideas on decorating and how you could set things up, though. We have gotten several pieces for kid's rooms and half the time things are missing or damaged. It's a PIA to have to drive back up there from Tucson to get the needed parts and it takes quite a bit of wait time out of your day.

FIRST: The penguin show! So you pay an extra $30 and a small group of 6-8 sit in a small hallway with one of the penguins! He just stands around or may walk between your feet but don't touch him! Not because you're not allowed to but rather, he's not a puppy. He doesn't realize petting and biting are not the same thing. If you want to pet him, the trainer will hold his head and let you feel his back and wings but if you want to touch him while he's walking past your feet, no ones going to stop you because you signed a waiver.

The bird exhibits are pretty cool too. They have feeding times published and it's quite a show. They'll let kids and adults put food in their hands and wait for birds to come snatch it.

I LOVE the place!  My son and I had so much fun just looking around.  I understand people expect perfection when they shop, but this is a brand new store, it will have kinks to work out for awhile.  The reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is that the couch we bought was delivered damaged (by the delivery people), but the company brought us out another couch and worked to make us happy.  However, I went back the other day looking for a dresser, and never got greeted by a salesman.  That is fine that there is low pressure sales, but would like some sort of attention when I go there.

"mZRKgCbpev_6zPNauXobOw","Hoover Dam Discovery Tour","Hoover Dam might as well have been built by aliens.  It came in at/under budget, exhibits the finest craftsmanship to this day (still perfectly-aligned aluminum door frames, art deco touches everywhere, Italian mason-crafted tile work with incredible detail, itself telling the stories of multiple Native American tribes in the area), and collectively inspiring even the most jaded visitor through sheer magnitude.

If you have the opportunity for the 2+ hour VIP tour, often led by the direct descendants of those who built the dam, take it.  Wear comfortable clothing - those louvered grates on the face of the dam are at the ends of crawlways.  Presuming the tour doesn't change, you'll get to crawl along one to see where ""Kilroy was here"" was written 80 years ago.

The tour we were on had foreign power company officials as guests.  They asked pointed questions about power generation over existing lines to the west (California).  The guide pulled no punches, noting that overtransmission does happen to meet demand, at the expense of a higher possibility of illness for those in close proximity to those lines.  Striking candor.  Your mileage may vary.

This dam is one of the wonders of the modern world - at minimum, take the nickel tour, and bring a camera.  At best, try the tour above.  It's worth the extra money, and then some.  From concept to construction to present-day production, this place is a trip.","1","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"
"zbihn0pA5MhMmUO3lOV01w","Pin-Up Pizza","I think this place is unique in the fact that the pizza is so oversized. However, taste wise, I don't think it was anything earth shattering. It is good, if you need a quick bite to eat or are in a hurry. Other than that, unless you want a novelty slice of pizza, I would go somewhere else.

There is no seating, so you either can eat at the standing counter, which is usually packed, or outside.

There is a decent selection of toppings, but the taste is mediocre. It wasn't anything I was raving about when I came home.

Also I was kind of confused with the name of the shop. Since, it is called pin up pizza, it is decorated in past pin up girls. However, I do not think the way the shop is set up as grab and go pizza that the theme makes much sense. Before we ate here I thought it was a pizza place where the waitresses were dressed up as pinup girls. Since it is Vegas, I was expecting over the top. Instead it is just a quick stop decorated in pinups of the past.","2","2","2","2","3","1","2","2","2","2"

I had their burger and sweet potato fry combo -- massive and awesome -- but I also couldn't take my eyes off of my friend's fish and chip plate -- also massive and awesome.

we (table for 2) got there fairly early on a Friday night around 6.30pm, so we were quickly seated at the bar after about 10 minutes. They also dont have space to hang your jacket anywhere so theres basically a pile on top of a keg in the corner.

Loved sitting at the bar watching the food and drinks being made. Everyone gets the Aburi Salmon, a good sized serving of fish, but way too much mayo for my liking. But the slightly torched crips on top added a great smokey flavour. But the Dyno Wings are the best, sticky, sweet and savory. They are large and meaty, crispy and saucy its just a whole lot of deliciousness going on.

Normally, I would never complain about it, however, when I simply asked about it, the waitress became rude and told me that the computer automatically did it as if it knew we were a party of 6!  Mind you, we had 3 separate checks of 2 people!  And that she could not take the gratuity off.  Then when we showed our displeasure of the service, including the lack of ice, she told us that they don't put ice in the drinks because people say the water is too cold!  After becoming very rude with me, I asked to just see where, in writing, did it state that the auto gratuity was done with parties of 6 or more.  She never was able to show me this!  I asked for a manager and she told me that SHE was the manager!  I highly doubt this!  Finally, a nice gentleman that was a server came over with new bills without the gratuity added.

"jbsY9L7M2V9eSCdyepJKPw","Sushi Hero","This restaurant is simply amazing for an All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant and here's why.

Small Portions - Sounds like a bad thing but it's amazing when you think about all of the different offerings you want to try.  The nigiri is small, but the fish to sushi rice ratio is on point.  Rolls are typically six pieces instead of eight, and appetizers are small enough to not get you full too quickly.

Fast Service - While the service is not exactly perfect, the food gets prepared quickly and the appropriate amount of attention is given during a busy lunch or dinner period.

Food Quality - There's no doubt about the quality of the food here.  I've been here at least three separate times and I can honestly say, for Las Vegas, this is one of the best places outside of the strip.  No need to drown your sushi in soy sauce and wasabi here, everything is good as is if you want to really taste it all.

We lived in Idaho for a year and I frequented the BEST elote truck ever and I've been searching for a place in Vegas to fill that void-Frijoles has got me covered! The food was super fresh.

I took a bite of my husband's quesadilla and it was good-but I wasn't able to snag a bite of nachos because he devoured them, so they must have been good as well. I didn't try any of the beverages, but I'd definitely like to next time. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you.

Cleveland is a city that's won my heart in many ways as it is in a resurgence period that if I were to move somewhere and be apart of something wonderful this place might be it. But that's Cleveland and I should talk about Danny's.

I've been fortunate enough to travel a lot and usually I get a pastrami or pastrami rueben where ever I go. If your in Los Angeles it's The Hat. If your in New York City it's 99 Park Avenue Grill. But if I lived near or within 50 miles of Danny's I would happily drive over for their breakfast and definitely for their Pastrami Rueben. It is not a stingy bit of meat on stale bread. Instead it's a heaping pile of why I'm happy were still a free country and service from some of the sweetest people you'll see on the either side of the Mississippi. It's small, it's local and it will leave you spending $11 on the greatest food you'll find. So, I'm off soon, but me and my party of 5 picky people are all ecstatic and can only hope to visit Cleveland again some day and hope that Danny's is still as good.

I placed an order which I had placed online for pickup. The website said that it would be 20 minutes. I got there 23 minutes later and the food was ready for me, awesome, no waiting. I opened the bag and there were no napkins or utensils, which is fine because i just took it home to eat. Had I taken to work or somewhere else, I would have been pretty much SOL. The bread was piping hot and fresh. They included olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but the vinegar to oil ratio was poor. The amount of vinegar was probably 1/20th the amount of oil. So basically i was left dipping already oiled focaccia into more oil. Not cool. I had to pour out most of the oil and add my own balsamic to get the proportion correct. The bread itself was good though.

I ordered the Jambalaya pasta which came with chicken and spicy sausage on fettucine. The pasta had a lot of flavor, but was really really greasy. By the end of the meal I had an entire layer of orange oil at the bottom of the plate. There wasn't that much sausage in the meal so it couldn't have all come from the sausage. My guess was that they went a little overboard on the oil when they made the sauce.

You can find me stocking up on Bacon wrapped pork, fried shrimp, orange peel chicken, lo-mein, cheese quessidillas, prime rib, fried chicken, chicken marsala, more prime rib, and french toast for my first three plates. My fourth plate will be a generous salad to cleanse and balance, followed by an assortment of cakes, brownies, cookies, fruits, and some jelly thing that makes me welcome diabetic shock. Grabbing a cone and hitting the soft serve machine, I'll take the last bit to go.

What? I have a high metabolism and don't want to leave hungry.","1","2","1","1","2","1","3","2","3","2"
"fBf1brms1ynO7vAIGVPCzQ","Sweet Jesus","This place really has so much hype, maybe too much hype.

It's not everyone's type of thing. Giant soft serve ice cream cones with loads of stuff on them. May seem exciting to some, to others it may be way over the top. I like simplicity myself when it comes to food (quality matters, right?) but I also enjoy the stuff Sweet Jesus presents. As a Christian, the title and signage sort of makes me uneasy (upside down cross lol), but that's not the main focus here. Anyway, the ice cream itself is alright, just normal soft serve. I haven't tried any of the drinks though, but I plan to.

I feel like this place has been a haven of the mindset of ""hey let's go to Sweet Jesus and take pictures of our crazy cones and post it to Instagram"" rather than the actual taste of the food. There's nothing wrong with that, and I could be wrong, but that's what I've observed. I've seen a lot people go wax-poetic about how great it looks, but end up saying ""meh"" after the experience.

But it seems to be working and doing well, since there's already two locations and a third one on the way at Yonge and Eg. Sweet Jesus, keep it up.","2","1","2","1","3","3","2","2","3","3"

He lifted my car and placed the trailing wheels on dolly with remarkable care and efficiency. He also practiced a safe and courteous driving manner.

I got the $40 massage which is basically a complete body massage. I made an appointment for 11am (but I do believe you don't necessarily need an appointment). I arrived about 10min early, but they took me in right away.

I got a lady named Susan, and she was great. The massage was awesome. She did my face, head, feet, legs, back, neck, and shoulders. It was a very relaxing massage but deep as well. One note, they do not have you take off your clothes for the massage like some places do, so I was very glad I wore shorts and a sleeveless shirt. It worked well.

The music and ambiance of the place was nice as well. Overall, it was a great massage, and I will most likely be returning there the next time I get a massage!","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

It actually provided a nice counterbalance to the sweetness of the donut, creating a more savory (But still delicious!) pastry.

The shop is cute but small, and they don't bake the donuts on site so once they're out they are OUT. Flavors also seem to change regularly. The day I was there (in May as I am slow to review) they had six options to choose from: oreo, maple bacon, glazed, raspberry, coffee, and lemon shortbread. I, of course, ordered one of everything. The donuts are a bit pricey at $3 each, but well worth the occasional splurge. Also, the gentleman behind the counter was super nice, and even opened his shop a little early when he saw that I was waiting outside. Thanks, Mr. Donut Vendor!

We were seated in the back and the waitress took our drink orders right away. The interior was home-y and comfortable and the bathrooms were really cute. I had a truffle oil, Stilton, onion and chive omelette that was TO DIE FOR. I've never had an omelette like it before in Toronto. Pretty damn good.

The first few times, I've visited during off-peak hours - the service was quick and friendly, and the store was clean. Big deal.

But last night we swung by Chipotle for dinner at the tail end of a serious dinner rush (right before 8pm). Line was to the door, full dining room - real tough situation for the line to handle. And you know what, they did great! The line moved smoothly, food swapped in and out seamlessly - great experience all around.

Burger was juicy and very tasty, price is comparable to other places in the Strip area. The fries were also very good however the $4.50 price was a little over the top. All total without tip my check was $20.55.

The service at this place is horrible. I was only checked on once and I sat around for 15 minutes waiting for the check after I was finished with my meal. Another waitress saw me but I guess she didn't say anything to my waitress. Good thing I had enough cash on me to cover the bill because I am sure it would of been another 15 minutes or more to process my payment.

One night they had crab legs and they smelt really bad to the point I couldn't eat them. The salad at the salad bar tends to be on its last leg.

The food is still great and hasn't changed so thank god for that one. What has changed is the service and staff. I'm not gonna judge people based on appearance but when it comes to the service industry appearance is everything. I did see people in uniform but just having a Bostons shirt on was it, some staff looked like they were wearing yoga pants and flip flops. Maybe they were off the clock and changed but still to see then in food service areas was kinda iffy for me.

Our server was trying but not hard enough. I can understand if you are busy and that you might have been the only one working at the time but if you pass by the table 5 times and to say nothing is kinda rude when we have yet to order.

When we get to the ticket booth I say ""Three for such-n-such movie"" and we walk in. Later on, I'm thinking ""Gee that was expensive"" and I look at the tickets and realize they've charged us for three adults. I figure I'll just catch the booth on the way out and see if they will refund me the difference - no biggie, because it was my own fault for not mentioning children.  But about 2/3 through the movie, my kids get too scared and want to leave - so we do. On the way out we hit the booth and I explain that through my own fault I overspent on the tickets, forgetting to note that two of our party were kids. All I wanted, if possible, was the difference between two adult tickets and two kids tickets, roughly 7 dollars total.  Instead, without being asked, they voluntarily refunded us the entire $34.50, noting that we hadn't stayed for the whole movie. Now that's classy customer service.

Off the strip, this is a Restaurant that definitely serves up traditional Cantonese dishes.  For the most part the food was ok.  One of my pet peeves on seafood is that it's got to be fresh.  We had a salt and pepper frog dish that was totally sub par.  Over battered and frozen frogs.  The second problem was they gave us a dish we did not order.  We ordered a basil clam dish.  But they ran out of basil so substituted a bell pepper onion with black bean sauce clam without telling us!!  Shouldn't you at least ask us before doing that?  The salt and pepper crab was good.  An Xo sauce was used as a try sautéed mix. That was their saving grace.  Now if course we had to check out the bathroom.  It was relatively clean.  The parking is also very convenient in a strip mall.  Overall experience is more like a 3.5.  Until next time...ciao!","2","1","1","1","3","1","3","1","3","2"

Pete's fish is ok, square, almost like processed but not. Strange but tasty. Chips are decent, taste like typical Ore-Ida frozen fries. The Onion rings were good (super greasy though). My biggest problem is that I am a bit of a traditionalist. If you are gonna call it ""fish and chips"" like they would in the UK, then you have to at least have malt vinegar. The red sauce is good with their fries and rings (and maybe shrimp) but not on fish. It is the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and may go back, if I am already in the area, to try one. I wonder if they have mustard? They may be trying to do too many things at once here. Seafood, Americana, Mexican, (fish, shrimp, burritos, hot dogs, chicken, oysters) Just a thought.

The seating is outside, if its summer you must get it to go. Between the heat, pigeons and huge flies (serious kitchen hawks) you will not have a good time.

The prices are very reasonable but they only accept cash. I would not go out of my way to eat at Pete's again.","1","1","2","1","3","2","3","3","2","3"

I had the sausage flat bread, which I would call an ordinary pizza, followed by the lobster mac and cheese. Back in the UK, macaroni cheese is a basic home cooked food for no special occasion, not restaurant food and I saw no reason to change that opinion after this meal. The lobster was nothing special either, lacking the slight sweetness and delicacy that it should have. Why would you mix those ingredients anyway?

Within several days, I started experiencing withdrawal symptoms from not having the previous medication and severe side effects from the new one. It took the office several hours to return my phone call. Really shows how much they care.

However, the interior of the Wynn's buffet is nicer and the prices are better. It also has superior brunch. For dinner, it doesn't matter either way because both buffets are the same.

Honestly, when it gets to the fancy $40 per person buffets, the food is pretty much the same. You get all the gourmet meats, all the gourmet desserts, and excellent service. To get anything else would be business suicide especially when you're catering to supposedly rich clientale.

One cute trick my brother figured out is if you come in towards the end of lunch and pay the lunch price, they will switch to dinner with the dinner foods.

I was there for a dinner with a vendor and since we were a party of 16, we had a prefixed menu.  I am giving 3 stars because I wasn't impressed with the NY Strip that I received.  I am always upset when a steak never comes out the way you asked for it to be cooked - why ask for a tempreature then?  I asked for Med-Rare and got Medium but I ate it.  But worse than the temperature was the over-usage of salt.  This steak was over salted which took away from the natural flavors.  The appetizer of New England Crab & Lobster Rolls were good but they were so small that it was more of 2 bites than 2 rolls.  As for the desert - it certainely wasn't what I ordered but since everyone got the same thing, I figured, they ran out of the other option.  But it wasn't anything that one couldn't make at home (bananas, ice cream, chopped nuts and chocolate syrup).

The decor was very nice and the service by the staff was exceptional.  Again, since it was a prefixed menu - I am not sure of the cost but it did seem pricey and based off of my meal, not sure it was worth the price.

I'm not handicapped but I stayed in the handicap room on the 9th floor it was nice because I liked the stand up shower but the carpets could have been cleaner if you stay below the 9th floor asked not to stare at a wall when you get your room. If you have a late flight there is a wrong with him keith your luggage until you want to pick it up after checkout. The beds are comfortable and the room with a nice size but mine did not have a refrigerator which I was kind of disappointed about. The shadow from the airport to the hotel we're running about 10 cab fare will run you about 15. Overall I enjoyed my stay there they also have a chocolate factories and the buzz and bee painting and wine session.","1","2","2","1","2","3","3","3","1","3"

Luckily I knew where the hotel was located or I would have driven right past the entrance. The parking situation is horrible. The parking layout is poorly designed and I spent far too much time waiting on other guests to park or drive past. The lady at reception did not greet us when we walked up to the front desk. I am an IHC Gold Elite member. The usual offer of bottled water was an after thought and she only offered a single bottle for two guests. There was no hair dryer in the room and when I called the front desk the lady responded as though I was lying. After a few minutes later a member of the housekeeping staff came to my room. She did not greet me as i opened the door. She came in and looked around the room as though I didn't think to look around for the hair dryer before calling the front desk. She did, however, return quickly with a hair dryer. Most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude. The breakfast area was incredibly crowded. The morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door. I opened the door and it was lying in the hallway with my personal information there for anyone interested in reading my bill.","2","2","2","2","1","3","3","1","3","2"

"tE5OPTuOTDYPDaLuWQpnNQ","Starbucks","I've been here once to this exact location when it was a Wendy's - for morning biscuits and sausage and some sludge that they called coffee. I tried it and ACK! Ended up pouring it out on the sidewalk in memory of the tastebud and synapse homies that died from the shock of that horrid flavor. I poured out more of that liquid diarrhea onto the sidewalk and prayed to the Goddess Caffeina that an actual Starbucks will one day rise up in the spot that the unworthy breakfast food and drink wannabe had inhabited. About a year later, my prayers had been answered - an actual Starbucks sure enough did replace Wendy's. Yeah!!!!! Opened pretty recently - I love what they did to the interior - nice wood panelling and the layout blows away what Wendy's had. Wendy's had the kitchen at the south end of the building. This new Starbucks has the cashiers and barristas at the southwest end. Service is as quick and easy as pretty much any Starbucks. They kept the drive-thru though so that's a plus. If you're gonna hang out with your laptop here long term, the southwestern most tables that are against a wall as opposed to a window view both have two outlets right underneath them. Lots of parking in this mall where Basha's is the anchor and there is lots of vacant retail space just waiting to be snatched up.","3","2","2","3","1","3","1","2","1","1"

Where I had an issue was the service. We he 5-6 different waiters/waitresses and not one gave off the impression they were our server. They were all really friendly but it was no wonder our order was wrong twice and had to wait 20 minutes for shrimp after I finished everything else.

We only ordered drinks, which were pricier than your average bar, but not any more expensive than anywhere else inside Encore.  They also had nuts and chips (the designer version... ;) ) which I snacked on while sipping my $9 Sapporo.

So you can't take care of it, because you know toasting a bagel and slapping some pre made stuff on it is hard work...

Not to mention the potato skins, cheese curds, pretzels, tater tots, and The Sasquatch (if you have the balls!).  For those looking for a tasty healthy alternative, they have the Half Viking which is a grilled chicken breast served with sliced avocado and your choice of sides (I recommend the spicy cottage cheese).

Each and every dish we tried deserved 5 stars and everything was beautifully plated.  I have had Miso Eggplant at a number of restaurants, but none of them come close to the way it is prepared here.  I still dream about it so I keep trying it at various local restaurants, but am repeatedly sorely disappointed.  Kumi's version melts in your mouth and is a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Yellowtail Serrano was fresh, vibrant, and absolutely perfect. But, the dish that blew me away was the Miso Black Cod.  Many restaurants attempt it, and none (that I've tried) nail it like these guys do.  Best I've ever had, hands down!  Seasoned perfectly and the fish is cooked to just the right degree (not too dry, which tends to be my complaint).  I would be willing to go back to Vegas for Kumi's Miso Black Cod alone!","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","3"

They have a really good magazine section in the back, on the old ""stage"" area that you can browse for hours without any interruption. I also enjoy the velvet theatre seats along the side walls, and the second floor mezzanine is good for reading in peace as there are small tables to sit at.

At one point there was a Starbucks Cafe upstairs but that has since been removed and replaced by a general health section.

There is also a good single washroom located near the front of the store that you can easily use without any fuss. If you're shopping in Bloor West Village and need to take a quick bathroom break and don't want to buy something, use this washroom.","3","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

The saving grace actually was the pizza. They had 5 different pies and the crust was tasty and the cheese was a good melty consistency. BUT I don't want to pay $50 for pizza. The prime rib was good, the ginger glazed carrots were phenomenal, the macaroni and cheese was watery. The dessert selection was just okay -- the typical cheesecakes and colored squares of mystery.

My only complaint is their sandwhich hours. I have been at least three times (either after 2pm or on Sundays) hoping for one of their sandwhiches and they are not being served.

Instead about half-pound of sprouts floated in sizzling oil.

In terms of the atmosphere, none of the wait staff was friendly, only half the food was labeled and the food that was labeled was labeled incorrectly.

On top of it all, our waitress wouldn't give us additional mimosas even though we supposedly paid for ""unlimited"" because she couldn't give us more than one glass each. Meanwhile, other tables were allowed full bottles of champagne. She went so far as to tell my friend she had to finish her glass before it could be refilled.

When we decided literally nothing was editable, we complained to the manager and without any hesitation at all he gave us a full refund which tells you just how often people must complain.

"iv7VL9LYmJFoUn09d5-Z1g","Caroline's Signature Salon","I purchased a Groupon for full highlights and a cut for $67. She texted me to schedule my appointment and I told her I had longer hair. When I arrived, she told me it would be an additional $40 (didn't mention that when I was booking the appointment). Charging extra is fine, but I think it's rude to have that information and wait until the appointment to let your client know it will be extra.

She was very nice and spent the whole time talking about her life and keeping conversation, but I did not like the extra charge nor how my hair turned out. Most of the foils came out light orange and very brassy, and were very far away from the root. Some foils are 1/2"" away from my head and look like they've grown out for the past 4-6 weeks. The entire coloring and cut process was very quick, just under two hours, and I feel that if a little more time was given to it, it might have come out better.

I ended up paying $127 for highlights and a cut with a $20 tip, only to come home and see how brassy the new foils were, and how far out she did the foils. I typically paid $95 to a name brand salon for the same services and always have a good experience. Unfortunately I now have to spend even more money to have someone else fix the chunky, brassy highlights.","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

I could see he was struggling with securing the ends but I figured he would tape it enough so that the plastic ends didn't open. Well, my sister got the tube today and all that was in there was the card. One of the plastic ends was missing and no gift.

I called the phone number listed and was quickly set up with an appointment.  Not even 24 hours later I was set to meet with an inspector at the condo. This particular gentleman (Tom was his name) was extremely thorough with his inspection, being patient with me and answering the plethora of questions I had along the way.

Tasting each component (broth, charred garlic oil, green onion, bamboo, black fungus, egg) separately. Mixing all the components together and tasting it as a whole.

"QLj6wviNN86M0cPF7NOYsw","Lulu","I generally don't like George Street clubs - the prices, atmosphere and people aren't really my scene. But I have to admit I quite like Lulu; all three of the previous complaints are better here than anywhere else. Downstairs from Tigerlily, Lulu looks like a bit of a cubby hole, and when you go inside it still looks small, but it is deceptively spacious. At the back you have the dancefloor, with pointless but quite amusing coloured lights underneath giving it a very Saturday Night Fever feel. The main area has good standing space and a load of sofas for when your heels get a bit too much (I would assume, generally not rocking the heels on nights out). They have a VIP area as well, with its own bar and cool comfy chairs, fitting up to about 50 ish people (the VIP area, not each chair obviously).

Depending on days and times the door prices vary, but it seems to generally be: early about a fiver and later (past 12) a tenner. This may seem steep but there are quite a few guest lists you can get yourself on to save a few pennies and sometimes queue jump. Again depending on the nights the drinks deals vary but you can get spirit and mixers for about £1.50 to £2.50. Just make sure you get the house spirits, sometimes the bar staff are a bit cheeky and try to give you the best vodka etc and charge you loads for it.

Overall it is a good club, probably the best on George Street, and if you like putting on your glad rags and dancing to chart / house / RnB then this is not a bad place to go to.","3","1","2","2","3","2","3","2","3","3"

The place isn't crazy packed like a casino, so while you don't get the experience in the hotel, it's still close enough to the action to really enjoy your stay.

We had the 1 bedroom studio (which, fair warning, is the 2nd bedroom of a 2 bedroom suite -- they close off the suite section to rent out as a 1 bedroom suite when they do this configuration.) so in this case we didn't get a true bed, but a murphy bed. It's not a pull out sofa, as some people seem to be saying. It comes out of the wall -- like a murphy bed. It was firm, which was perfect. But I could've done with a better bed. Can't complain though on this one because linens were clean, everything was fresh.

Will definitely be back!","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"
"ffjqoa-DVEtCP7bNoUJrYg","Love Gelato","Our big group of yelp friends came here for a quick dessert after having a less than satisfying meal at a place down the street. We were walking (some running) here because we wanted to catch some gelato before it closed.

Need to note that I almost fell on my face 4 times walking to here because of all the rubble on the floor that you can't see when it's dark. This place REALLY is a hidden gem.. so hidden that I would've never found it if it wasn't for Cherrie T's leadership (since she had gelato already before dinner). The place is tucked away in a corner and definitely not in view of the main street. The place itself is pretty small and the washroom is absolutely tiny. However, it's very homey and I like it a lot. The gelato was AMAZING. I got a small (which includes 2 scoops of flavours) in a cone and it was A LOT. Yummy, creamy, smooth and not too heavy- exactly what I look for in a dessert.

The staff there were sweet as honey and didn't get frustrated accommodating our large group of 10+ and a few more other people even though they were going to close soon. They even took down the chairs they put up to close for the night so we can stay a bit past their closing time to enjoy our gelato. We really appreciated that!

10/10 would come back.","3","2","1","2","3","3","2","3","2","3"

I hate to write a bad review but my visit was disappointing at best. The sad thing is that it's next to my house and I race mountain bikes, so I'm always in need of parts.

The steak was not medium and the potato was not mashed, but we had a show to catch and just couldn't wait any longer. The restaurant did comp the cocktail and the last entree. From the looks of things, other guests at tables around us were having the same issues. The wait staff seems to spend most of their time off the floor, away from guests.

Of course not, but it was a little disappointing since I really like the veggies with my wings.  The pizza had good flavor, but the crust was chewy and quite tough.  I did enjoy the tomato sauce on the pizza though.  The dining room was really lacking, and there was a random table cloth covering something up next to the drink station.

Classic food, nothing trendy or adventurous.  We did not have soup, but had salads.  Both were interesting and flavorful.  Entrees were flavorful and portion size was generous.  Desserts were amazing, if you have room.  Nice selection of cheesecakes.  Wine list is extensive, but our first two choices were out of stock.

The first batch of hot wings were crispy, but the next 2 were not; and I do not like soft chicken wing skin! Yuck.

So I recommend making sure to order extra crispy if you are like me!

Finally, on one of the trips our curiosity got the best of us and we decided we should stop in and check it out.  Surprise!!  It is much more than a library or book store!

We started out touring the Graham Family Homeplace, the house Billy Graham was raised in that was actually moved to its current site from nearby.  The staff there were happy to share insights about his life in that house.  Then we went on (side note: beautiful grounds for walking) to the main building that contains a gift shop and book store called Ruth's Attic Bookstore, a restaurant called the Graham Brothers Dairy Bar, and a partially self-guided tour, A Journey of Faith, of key events in Billy Graham's Life.

After finishing the tour, we knew a lot more about Billy Graham, the person, and his beliefs and what he stood for.  Moreover, we can appreciate why he is so respected by people all over the world.

How do I know I didn't get the hot lava foam car wash package?

Got there right at opening (10:45).  Everything was out and ready.  Everything was neat and fresh.  One of the soups out was not on the online menu and the mushroom soup was missing.  The front end manager noticed my hesitancy in choosing a soup and made a comment and I told him I was looking for the mushroom soup and he said somebody forgot to order the heavy cream called for and the back end manager was out scouring stores looking for enough.  So I tried a pretty good vegetable beef..  Of course I built a big salad and also had a cold noodle salad and some potato salad and some corn bread.  The only thing I really did not care for was the pizza, but then again this isn't a pizza place.  About 1/2 way through my meal the manager brought over a bowl of mushroom soup from the back, still without the cream but quite tasty.  While this place should be a 3, that attention to customer service in a buffet got them a 4th star.  Everybody I came in contact with was pleasant.

Overall I think I prefer the salad bar at Sizzler because it does a better job of the hot area while being about equal on the salad part of it and they are just down the street from my shop.  But I just might make the drive again with another coupon.","2","2","2","2","2","3","3","2","3","3"

This was also the first restaurant (besides a sushi bar) where the entire staff works from behind the the bar.  That in itself is a very unusual site, especially at a fancy restaurant.

The decor was is very trendy and modern with a lot of black and red colors.  There was a lot of Easter theme decorations (in a very classy way) around the restaurant.  Most of the seating is along the bar with a few tables on the dining floor.

Also, you don't destroy the threads by simply loosening a plug; the threads are destroyed when the drain plug is screwed in too tight.

Well, I was very disappointed by what happened after I sat down. I was one of the last in the party to arrive and it took the server 10 minutes to come and take my drink order. It wasn't a big deal as I as with my friends and having a great time socializing.

I ordered from the DIY Taco menu and was very excited that I'd get to create what I ate. I just knew it was going to be wonderful. Wrong. The meat was overcooked and chewy and the accompaniments did not go well together. This could have been blamed on myself because I did choose what to put on my tacos (I doubt it. However, everyone at the table felt the same way and they ordered their tacos straight off the menu. The drinks were overpriced and I had the worst guacamole I've ever had in my entire life. I tried to fix it, but it could not be saved.

I ordered a Caesar salad with my meal and the server asked me if Caesar dressing is ok with that....um...yes, isn't that why people order Caesar salads? She also must have entered our table number incorrectly as we had to flag down everyone who was carrying each of our courses as they wandered aimlessly around the dining room trying to figure out where they went.  I had the beef tenderloin quartet. I ordered it medium rare. Came out well done. I had to flag down a manager to ask which pieces had which crusts and what the sauces were. He knew all of them except one sauce. Then told me which sauce was recommended to pair with which crust, which is not how it was plated. My friend had the burger. It was fine. The coleslaw was bad, it had zero flavor. It was overlooked as well. Dessert was the 2nd worst part. Canned peaches and a scoop of ice cream.  Worst part was the awkward moment when the server shows you your total on their little tablet then you have to write in the gratuity as they stand there staring at you.

We arrived on a Friday night around 9:30 for our 9:45 reservation. It looked pretty busy so I think the reservation was a good idea. It saved us about a 30 minute wait time. The hostess was awesome and very patient when explaining the serving process. Which is pretty interesting if you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, but I won't spoil it!

We started with the salad which I had a heard from others that they could be better but I wasn't there for the salad anyway so I didn't pay to much attention to it but It was tasty. Then it was time for the real deal, the meats. My girlfriend said it reminded her of her grandfathers cooking! That's when I knew it was authentic Brazilian. I was speechless the flavors the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat was INCREDIBLE! My girlfriend was also super excited about the Guarana which is her all time favorite soda from Brazil!

She still wanted one more test. When one of the gauchos came to our table she asked him what meat it was in Portuguese and HE RESPONDED!!! I don't think they all speak Portuguese but the fact that one did told us that they really did bring the culture and the authenticity to the table.

The aesthetics of this restaurant were somewhat lacking, but I'll that let slide since it's the food that matters usually. Though I wish this place had A/C to begin with...

As for the burger itself, it tasted...exactly like a $5 burger. The American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, and Murray mayo all tasted good...however the patty was smaller than what I had anticipated, similar to a quarter pounder. I guess for $5 you shouldn't expect much, and the cashier (who by the way is one of the best in doing her job) did say the portions will be smaller in order to accompany the fact it's a $5 burger. Fine, I'll give it a pass.

Will I come back though? If I'm in the area, I'll definitely consider. However with the burger joints around the city it certainly doesn't hurt to explore around.","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","3","3","3"

The honey was just enough to sweeten the espresso without being too sweet or overpowering the taste of the espresso. I would order it again.

The bakery was staffed by three women and they were all friendly. The bakery case has an assortment of treats from sugar cookies to kolachy to macarons to biscotti and much more. This would be a great place to meet a friend and sit for a chat or grab a drink and a snack before walking around the square.

The office then handed me an empty food container (I find it hard to believe that these two ate ALL of the food that was sent with them, but OK), and that was it. I asked where the medication was...it was a whirlwind to get that back. There was NO indication on the calendar I provided that any medicine was administered, but I could tell it was, based on the amount of medication left. I didn't know where they were in the cycle of administering, and neither did they. Seemed like the left hand didn't know what the right was doing.

At least one guest brought his pistol. Noise level is surprisingly reasonable on a Saturday night and we had no trouble having a conversation.

This place offers the right amount of sweetness and fruits. It's very refreshing. Make sure you order it when one of the girls are working the counter, they'll give you a big mound of ice and put mochi in it. The guy, if he's there, is a little stingy. That's why they get 4 stars today. Also, im kind of a traditionalist when it comes to this dessert so I like mung bean or soybean powder on mine. But that's my personal opinion.

The surroundings are beautiful, prettier than the Bellagio or Ceasars buffet by far. The wait wasn't long to get in but that's where the prompt service ended. The waitress was very friendly and apologetic but they were understaffed and she couldn't keep up. They took a while to clear plates and very slow to bring drinks. We did the endless champagne brunch and it was a total waste of money since the waitress only brought 2 over.

Lots of choices, a little something for everyone. Some of the food was excellent: pancakes, country potatoes with lobster, sausage from the carving station, lox and definitely more but I can't remember all of it. But there was also huge disappointments: anything in the Asian or dessert section was inedible. The desserts all seemed like they had been previously frozen and left with terrible textures. And unfortunately I think I'm spoiled with Dim-sum at home but it was definitely a miss too.

I appreciate the doggie bag stations along the way so pup owners can ensure good hygiene for the park.

I am thrilled to see growth in Uptown...now if they can only get retail to move up there.","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

Primarily near Latino neighborhoods I knew form visiting the other Bonanza location that the food they offered from the restaurant inside would be good. I have been a soft taco kick for a while and ordered the 3 taco special (Carnitas, Lengua, and Chicarrones). They were all great along with the beans and rice for only $5.99. Service was quick as they bring you your food to a little dining area, If you care to you can watch them chop and prepare your meal behind the glass. They also offer other hot foods by the pound as well. This location is not as large as the other location east of this one but it was just as friendly and clean. Walking around after enjoying my meal all the prices seem reasonable to other supermarkets.","2","2","3","3","1","2","2","2","2","1"

I only tried one and it was really nice.  I don't remember the name, because I asked the owner?? what he would recommend to someone who drinks lighter beers.  He served me one that was perfect.

"C1_pmW4YyD0EXcntJuGHtw","South Side Plumbing & Heating","I had used this company numerous times in the past for my rental property and called them for a for a heating issue in late 2008.  They came to the property relatively quickly and immediately got to work.  Once they diagnosed the problem, they told me what needed to be done, procured the parts and completed the job.  I paid for the job in its entirety as soon as the work was finished.

A few weeks later they sent me a bill for an additional $75 trip charge that was never mentioned.  I told them I would not pay it since it was never  disclosed that this charge existed.  They fought with me and insisted that they did tell me about it.   In my mind, had they actually told me, why was it not part of the original invoice?  They kept sending me invoices once I told them that I would not pay a fraudulent charge.  I then complained to the Better Business Bureau about their fraudulent business practices.  I thought the dispute was settled and then found out a few months later that they had sent me to collections!

It is clear to me that for whatever reason this firm is willing to turn their back on a repeat customer and damage their reputation in the community for a mere $75.  One of their employees made a mistake  and did not advise me of the $75 trip charge so rather than making the employee responsible, they are trying to make their customer take the fall.  I would NOT use this plumber.  There are plenty of others in the Pittsburgh area that won't rip you off and try to ruin your good credit.","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","3"
"4F0tS2yBSjLG_N_a-EEp7A","Lola","I was in town last week for business and ate here twice.  Once for lunch with a group from the meeting I was attending then back by myself for dinner.

At  lunch I had the Braised Bacon which was spendid - beautiful cubes of the pork glazed with a Japanese-like mahogany lacquered glaze.  It was tender and rich with the thin ribbons of fat every so often,  Perfect with some of the warm bread served at the table.  I followed with the Duck Confit Salad with Strawberries, Toasted Hazelnuts, and Goat Cheese.  I have to admit, the pork and duck together in one meal was a bit rich but I was trying to be mindful of costs being with a work group.

For dinner the next evening, I decided to go with 3 appetizers.  I started with the Pomegranate-Fig Martini - great, not as sweet as one would think.  First dish was the Cured Tuna w/Citrus Segments & Fennel.  It was absolutely top-notch - fresh, all flavors clean and working beautifully together. Next up, Crispy Pig Ear with Frisee, Mushrooms & Poached Egg.  I think my eyes rolled back into my head this was so good!  The pig ear was not one piece as I thought it would be but extremely thin ribbons absoluetly crispy and chewy at the same time.  The poached egg was done perfectly, white was set and the yolk broke over the salad giving it the beautiful creamy mouth feel. Finished with the Beef Cheek Pierogi - very good but it couldn't compare to the other two dishes.

I think Lola is a definate must for fellow foodies.  Great food, decor, and atmosphere.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

Surprisingly, we were able to get reservations relatively last minute and oh how we enjoyed our meal! It was slightly challenging to locate the restaurant (on the 10th floor of the Venetian), but this had the added benefit of weeding out much of the typical tourist riff raff. Hint - look for the Venezia tower/elevator.

Start to finish, the food was positively delectable. I especially enjoyed the appetizer du jour that was comprised of white asparagus gelee, fresh strawberries and balsamic vinegar. The 100% homemade (pastry, ice cream, & chocolate sauce) profiteroles were a brilliant finish to a perfect meal.

Our server was super knowledgeable and extremely congenial. He really impressed me by recommending a fantastic chardonnay/bordeaux  to pair with my monkfish entree.

Room was clean, had semi balcony doors opening to the pool view, and a super comfy bed. Bathroom was smallish compared to HRH tower. Ate at Pink Taco and Mr luckys..

Both were good and I would go back. The casino experience was completely underwhelming though.

I had taken several casino markers and after knowing I was back to even, colored up and wanted to buy the markers back. The dealer colored me up incorrectly on two different occasions, saying I was a few hundred short. Since I knew what I had, I asked for a surveillance review and after 40 mins of waiting, was colored up correctly and bought the markers back. It's not professional when a dealer cannot properly count chips, and you have to waste nearly 2 hours collectively waiting. Very poor service in the casino..","2","2","2","2","3","2","3","2","1","2"

We came for a family meal for my brother's birthday. One server was really nice and when I asked if the bread had egg or milk he brought me out separate bread and a separate salad without cheese. This was great and I really appreciated how thoughtful the server was. The rest of my experience did not go like this. When I order my main meal I had a different server who got really irritated that I had restrictions and was vegan. He kept offering me gluten free and when I asked about the pizza dough he didn't get back to me. He never got back to me on if my order had dairy or egg and stopped coming by our table. When he brought out my order and I asked again if it had dairy or eggs in it. He asked and it turned out there was dairy in it. He offered to see if I wanted something else but at this point the server was being pretty passive aggressive and clearly didn't want to interact with me so I didn't feel comfortable ordering something else. I stuck with my bread and salad and picked up food on my way home. The rest of the group enjoyed their meal, this just isn't a good place to come if you're vegan.

Tuesday is Bacon Night! which truthfully is really gross and cold. More tummy aches for you, BUT if you want to go out on a Tuesday, this is the bar where you'll be in good company. You can always go across the street to Ian's if you desperately need some bacon.

If you have to wait in line at night, Wandos definitely has the best set up with a heat lamp once you get near the windows. That being said, the layout of the place kinda sucks. It's long and thin and is always super crowded so you can never move around. Additionally they create another line to get to the upstairs area and that takes up even more of the very little room they have. If you do manage to get up there though, it's really nice. They keep the top level from getting as crowded as the lower ones, there's usually a DJ, theres an extra bathroom and the bartender to customer ratio rocks up there. Good luck getting a spot though, everyone up there knows how good they've got it.","3","2","2","3","2","3","1","2","2","2"

We have always had a good experience at Georgetown... until a couple weeks ago. There was a large shard of glass in our mac and cheese. We immediately asked for the manager who seemed to careless. She had a smirk on her face and had no intention of making it right until we told her we didn't want our food. We are talking about glass in our food!

The waitstaff was very attentive and the food was delish, I tried the lamb for the night.

I literally felt that I was dropped into the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Sat next to a couple who proceeded to explain to us why we are still Greek, even though we are Irish and Italian and then (after verifying multiple times that we were married) kept telling us how we need to have babies! Awesome experience. Most of the people in here were Greek.

Sat outside...it was nice and shaded and got to play a game of checkers. We ordered the pita and hummus and the lamb kabobs on special. The hummus was simple, yet, perfect. The lamb was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. It came with a large greek salad and some fries. Everything we had was just so delicious and authentic. The couple beside us convinced us to get this cake, which I couldn't pronounce. It was absolutely amazing.

Awesome place that we will definitely return to when the Greek food craving hits again!","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

However, there are ALWAYS creepy men walking in, out, or even more worryingly sitting or standing by the entrance. I've been in there to hand out Cvs quite a while ago, before I knew ofcourse about The Vibe, and very little would make me head back there.

Went with some friends on January 23, 2014 and it appears they've raised the prices again - a slice of cake is a whopping $14, on top of the $5 admission fee to play games. When we arrived at 9pm, we were told the hot drinks bar had already closed and they wouldn't be serving coffee, lattes, hot chocolates etc. (which is what we had intended to order). So, when we told our waiter we didn't want to order anything, he said the fee would then rise to $20 instead of $5 per person.

FIRST OF ALL, I DID trade in a car.  Second of all, how many people fully understand what they're signing?  When the finance manager told me to sign something, I did it.  I trusted them.

We really enjoyed the super fresh salsa, guac and chips while we mulled over which tacos to try. We each got three mini tacos and by far my favourite was the fish taco! I would love to back and eat many many more of them! The fish was battered: crispy but not greasy. There was a creamy but citrus-ee dressing and it was topped with a satisfying crunchy shredded slaw (can't remember what it was).

Not only because of today's visit but based on past visits as well.  I don't expect great service when going to places like this but I do expect at least a minimal amount.  On today's visit the food was so so.  When my fajitas came out they did not provide the shells and sides.   I waited five minutes and had to remind the staff before I got those.   Because I got the 2x fajitas, I later asked for more shells.   The server said she was on it but in reality probably forgot the second she left my table.   They never came.

Inside you'll find a generous seating area, and no matter when you go there are certain to be people in there chatting, or reading a paper over coffee.  The place seems to be very family friendly.

The offerings involve any sort of coffee drink you're after, as well as lovely pastries and more traditional Portugese desserts and breads.  On the menu are also some sandwiches and other lunch-type items, but I haven't had any.  Generally I will go to Courense to change it up from my old standby Nova Era (just a block away).

If you disregard this bar out of hand for their scantily-clad-waitress-Scottish-theme shtick, you're doing it a disservice.

I've had their Shepherd's pie, which is very good if you're looking for a more substantial lunch, but I keep coming back to their Black and Blue burger- Simply a blackened patty with blue cheese. Their BBQ burger is also good. I can't put my finger on what it is, but I like me some Tilted Kilt burgers.

There aren't any huge surprises here. Tilted Kilt is a chain, and primarily a bar, so there is going to be the usual bar fare with a Scottish twist.

The service has always ranged from good to outstanding when I've gone. And on that note let me relate a story: My co-worker ordered a well done burger, and his arrived rare. He politely said, ""I can't eat this."" That is all he said. Not only did  the waitress apologize and replace his order, the manager came by the table and apologized, they comped his meal, asked if he wanted a beer (since they were buying!), and gave him a gift card to pay for his next visit.

The booze is a standard selection of draughts and spirits, but at riduculously cheap prices. They do one of the best pints of strongbow going. I know, I know its not exactly a premium cider but it is easy to get a bad pint of this stuff. Three pints less than a tenner with a healthy ammount of change coming back to you thumbs up from me.

However, when get enter it, we saw so many empty tables (except for those people go get food) and they are just not cleaned yet, which on the other hand shows how much they lack of nice operating management.

The food quality, I gotta say, is quite unstable. the food I liked last time wasn't good this time. Tomato soup, smoked pork belly and tuna salad are recommended, but not sure whether they would be good next time. Many dishes are too salty, which makes us realize that we are still young with a sensitive tongue. Desserts are always the scoring point and they are doing fine.

The beer got gross and warm, but the fun kept coming.  They had a fun band playing and we danced our asses off while eating soft pretzels dipped in cheese sauce and other supposed German delicacies.  We had a large group with us and they allowed us to rent out the front room next to the bar.  We had a great time and the staff was really nice.

As we were walking to the entry, a woman leaving informed us there was a half hour wait. While it appeared to bother her we felt lucky it wasn't longer.

Entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly greeted right away. The waitress apologized and said that the wait was about 15 minutes. She also apologized and said that the management was cooking but didn't explain why the regular cooks were not there. To make this a bit shorter than I could, suffice it to say, our waitress was extremely helpful and pleasant. While my husband ordered his favorite club sandwich, I took a chance that the Turkey dinner special might still be available. Not only was it, but both of our meals were excellent and served pretty quickly. I could not have enjoyed my turkey dinner more!!

Though, I felt we should worry when there was more staff than there were patrons. I really wanted to be objective. However, I could not help but compare the food to my regular establishment. And the food was nothing to write home about. I ordered an omelet and asked to add diced onions and diced bacon, but what I got was roughly chopped onions and bacon.  Despite ordering my side of bacon crispy, the bacon in my omelet was limp and barely cooked, to my standards. The one good thing was the freshly squeezed orange juice. $55 later and dissatisfied. We never spent over $30 at the other place. I decided I would pay with my credit card and leave a cash tip. I took it as an affront when the server took the check before we were finished and before we left her tip. She saw no tip on the slip and never came back. We left $10 on a $45 tab, despite her not returning to our table. I never write reviews, but felt that, if I did not, how would others know.

Given we had a group of 25, I had fairly low expectations for the service, but they did an excellent job! From the time we sat down to the time we left it was just over two hours, which I think is pretty decent with a group that size!

Now beware, the menu is huge. Pages on pages! I had my mind made up three different times and finally when put under some pressure, made a decision. I settled on the Frisco Burger and fries, a swiss cheese burger with thousand island dressing served on grilled parmesan sourdough (like toast, not a bun). It was tasty but nothing special. I actually wish it were served on a bun. If I were to describe my eating pace, I'd say its fairly normal (if I'm not lying, a little quicker than the average) and the bread quickly became soggy. The fries were also nothing special, thinly cut with a good crunch. Again, nothing wrong with the food but I could get a similar burger under ten bucks elsewhere.

"LFqEvdRRr1nCd6JbNc5hZQ","Jyuban Ramen House","The waitress was really nice and can tell she was passionate about the food there. She highly recommended the pork belly snack and repeated said its their best. She was definitely right, the pork belly was extreme delicious. Ordered a pork belly ramen and the snack, was not wrong to get it twice. Only mistake was ordering the small. The cha siu is by far the best, compared to other ramen places. The soft boiled egg was really well done, the yolk was soft and sweet but not runny.

The disappointing thing was the noodle and the soup. The noodle resembled Chinese egg noodle, it was nothing like ramen. Probably the worse ramen tried to date. The soup was nothing special and combined with the noodles, it seemed like something that is served at a Chinese cafe.

Overall, maybe come back and try a donburi with a pork belly snack dish. Will definitely get a large next time, double the number of pieces.","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","3","2"

After the last day I got hungry and did not want to go to a fancy sit down, so decided to give this place a try. The entire place was empty. This is a fairly large restaurant. I ordered a Chicken Burger, Onion rings and a diet coke. The total came out to $28.00. We are talking about a place like Habit Burger. I got sick after eating at this place and strongly feel I should get a refund. I hate to write negative reviews, but this place can not get even two stars from me. I understand its inside the Venetian, so the rent will be higher thus the prices will be substantially more than a regular place, but there is no excuse for bad product, especially when you charge $28.00 with tax. I will not comeback to this place. With sadness this place gets my first ever one star review on Yelp. I would think 100 times before coming back.

These burgers meet all three of my burger criteria: 1) perfectly cooked to order - just a little pink for me; 2) massive - totally worth sharing them; 3) toppings, toppings, toppings - gouda?! caramelized or fried onions?! You're speaking my language, ASBC.

The first time I went, my husband and I split the farmhouse burger with regular fries. I personally wasn't a fan of the regular fries. Second time, we shared the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries.

The menu changed a bit since the last time we were here and they altered a few names so ordering with a little confusing. The menu change seems like they added a lot of new items, which is great. Our orders came out pretty quickly, but we should have taken advantage of the half order rolls at the end since we were stuffed and felt pressure to clean our plates (our fault for ordering a bunch at once). Our favorites were the crunchy rice with salmon, Wild West, super white, tuna poke, monkey brains, and Mojave beach roll. The worst was the New Mexican roll, the habanero sauce was good and super spicy, but such an odd flavoring with the cilantro. We had mochi ice cream (coffee and cookies and cream), which were delicious even though we were so stuffed! Lunch was $21.","2","1","2","1","3","3","1","1","2","2"

"TScyq0NEfw4pBopIBLykrw","Manheim Steamroller Christmas","I should have known better when,  I bought tickets to the Washington D.C. Christmas show and my friends remained silent. Start to finish, this show was just a huge disappointment. Hokey, outdated, four or maybe five guys, one overly dramatic woman (playing a synthesizer  - one handed!) with what I am guessing was some sort of background tape to beef up the sound. Yes, there was a small cadre of violins but no way did the group produce that bigger sound. Cheesy Christmas scenes displayed on a fuzzy screen was - I guess - supposed to distract, and for me, it did as I kept thinking someone might introduce them to a video art app or maybe any computer program. Just outdated. The creator, Chip Davis, addressed the audience from somewhere else reminding us about this updated 2016 version of the show. Really?  If you love Burl Ives as Frosty the Snowman, this is the concert for you! They called it in. The soloist, daughter? (brought to us via that fuzzy screen again) sang from another concert venue, probably in another century too. Maybe she's now a granny. The drummer gave little balance to the rest of the group just banging away as they stood on their ""marks"" never attempting to liven it up with movement. I never thought much of the 70's fashion-wise, and this concert solidified those feelings. Some people did give them a standing ovation but then, they were baby-boomers and I suspect hearing impaired. At $100. a ticket (times two,) this baby-boomer felt robbed.","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","1","1","1"

I ordered the Shack Burger with fries and I wasn't pleased. They really skimped on tomatoes and lettuce and I couldn't tell what their Shack Sauce tasted like at all. Did they even put any sauce in my burger? I was disappointed with the flavor. The meat patty itself was fine, but everything else about the burger was underwhelming. The price was the final deal breaker for me.

Perhaps the Shack Burger was not the best thing on their menu, but for their signature name burger, it was rather disappointing. I read that some of their other burgers are better and that their shakes are really good, though, so if you try Shake Shack, take a pass on the Shack Burger and get something else.","3","2","2","3","2","2","2","2","3","2"

After a week had passed and I had not received results I called and was told they would call me back with results. In the 6 weeks after the date of lab I had to call back twice, leave a voicemail once, and email once to get a response. Finally, I was quickly over the phone that I was positive for one of the tests and they would need my pharmacy info. I asked for this to be repeated because it was said so quickly and I was put on hold for the 4th or 5th time.

If you have been to Mastros in North, North Scottsdale and Ocean Club then you will have a fair comparison although it doesnt quite have the best opportunity to people watch in the lounge like Ocean Club.

The Bangkok noodles had a nice flavor with just the right heat. Only issue for me would be that it's either over sauced or the sauce needs to be thinned out a bit.

Basically, the owner is really pompous.  He thinks that he has the best food to offer in town and that he knows everything.  On my last visit, my friends and I were very uncomfortable and he didn't get the hint.  People come to dinner with their friends to speak to their friends- not some random guy that is going to tell you about how you're not intelligent if you don't love the food he happens to service.

On another note, this place is expensive for what they are trying to serve.  I mean, they just heat up some cold food and charge you $13 for said re-heated meal.  Then the owner randomly disrupts your over-priced, re-heated meal.

I'm sad to say that this neighborhood joint of mine won't be getting any of my money again.  Since my initial visit, it has only went downhill.","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","3","3","3"

My mom and I were looking for a car and went to several dealerships.  Buying a car is a nerveracking experience and unfortunately most car dealerships (and salesmen) don't often make you feel comfortable while doing so.  Josh made sure we felt comfortable from the get go and put us at ease which was extremely appreciated.  In addition, Josh and the car sales team did their best to get us the best deal possible.  While we were only able to offer a certain amount, they did their best to try to meet it and also were extremely respectful of the time limit we mentioned (we needed to leave by a certain time frame and they made sure we were out by then).

Sure some of their groceries are a bit over priced and this particular locations produce isn't as stellar as a Safeway or a Sprouts, but I like this location for their great little organic section and their liquor section is pretty decent. I've gotten some really good pre-made food in their deli section. Just recently they had home made chicken pot pies and they were very good. To me Basha's has a small town grocery store vibe and not like a chain (even though it is a chain, but a local one). The employees that I have dealt with at this location have been nice and some will usually make small talk.","2","3","2","3","3","2","2","2","2","2"

We tried outside once but the flies drove us inside. Certainly not the diner's fault. The staff is incredibly hometown friendly. Portions are large enough that you can plan on taking half home for a second meal. My favorite is the one pound hamburger steak smothered in onions with mashed potatoes and gravy. Very few people like, or have tried, liver and onions. It was especially good. Breakfast dishes are very, very good and the stack of pancakes can feed a village for a week. Prices are low for the quality and quantity. The place is always packed so parking is sometimes a concern. Oh yes, be sure you try the Sea Salt-Mineral Oil hand washing compound offered for free in the rest room. Worth the price of admission.","1","2","3","2","1","2","3","3","2","2"

Very dangerous. It died again and i finally brought it back where they assured me my fluids were just low and it was safe to drive now. It died again, but this time in traffic while turning left in a busy intersection. the car had to be pushed to the side causing a major traffic jam. i brought it back where they told me it was the crank shift something in my engine, this time they ASSURED me that was the problem (again????) and the car died 2 weeks later. Furious i call my service advisor, who wasn't very good at her job, Maureen and she directs me to her supervisor, Eric. he had a terribly arrogant tone with me and says the words ""if your car doesn't die constantly we can prove that there is actually something wrong with it"".

He cleaned a spot and made sure I thought it was clean enough. He wasn't happy with it and grabbed a different cleaner and made sure I saw the true results. I was so blown away by his care for the results.  Back to the carpet, half way through the cleaning he showed me how good the rooms looked and made sure I thought the results were acceptable!

We also both got desserts, the key lime pie (my all time favorite dessert) and that was incredible and the bourbon pecan pie, which my fiance said was also amazing and was served warm. The reason for 3 stars is the service. Our waiter, Brandon, acted like he couldn't care less that we were there, just kinda threw the food down and walked away, checked on us only once and honestly just didn't even try to offer good service. The bus boy who refilled water, brought bread and took our plates came around more often than he did. However, when a group of older people came in he was so attentive and pointed out everything on the menu to them, went over where the seafood was from and took all the time in the world as he probably assumed they had more money than we did.

The chicken alone is really quite good, and coupled with the special dipping sauce that they have, it makes a killer combination, it really does. The servers here are not the greatest, the food mediocre, and for this particular location there is so much seating, and its so open that it almost has a negative effect on the location...It makes it seem as though there isn't many people in the restaurant, and that its not very popular because of all the empty seats, at least that's the way I see it. The servers here are slow, and took forever to even give us the bill last time I was here, like they took so long I was about ready to just leave without paying...It was ridiculous, yet I still tipped...But I really won't be coming back here anytime soon, if there's another option available I'll jump on that before ever checking this place out again.","2","1","1","1","3","3","3","1","2","3"

They've done a slight renovation, brightening the space with a coat of white paint, new lighting, and some tasteful splashes of colour.  The menu is tapas style-- we had mussels in a white wine broth, octopus in a tomato sauce, and fried artichokes with a puttanesca dipping sauce, followed by a small cheese plate.  The plates are larger than what you are usually served in Toronto tapas places, but the quality does not suffer: it was all excellent, as was the sourdough bread.  They have an impressive array of olives on the menu which you can mix and match. This is a great place for drinks and an elegant, informal dinner.  They have a nice selection of wine and beer, and some great looking cocktails (we stuck with beer and wine on this visit).  Staff at Nuit are very friendly and knowledgeable, and able to make helpful recommendations, without pushing you to order more as is sometimes the case in tapas places.

There bibim bap was acceptable but didn't have the usual mushrooms even though they showed them in the menu picture so my wife was a little disappointed but the large amount of bulgogie they put in almost made up for it. The staff are generally friendly but can be difficult to get their attention. Nice having many tv's to show the game while eating. I like how they provide a jug of water but I'd like the option of hot tea. Also like how they have the paper napkins at the table instead of only providing one per person like other cheap restaurants. Also their napkins are the best quality I've seen.

So was it all that bad? Not really. Granted it wasn't sold out so there was plenty of space and never a line to get a drink which helped. Parking was $5 which wasn't a big deal and we got there in plenty of time to grab a space (made for a hyper quick escape at the end of the show!). Drinks for $7.50 for and $5 for a beer which again didn't seem over the top to me.

The sound was a bit crappy I will admit and having seen Sia two years ago at the Hotel Congress in Tucson I can only hope she relocates her choice of AZ venue when she comes back. It wasn't so bad it ruined the evening and the mix got better as the set went on.

They floated around, browning and sizzling, then he took them out and put them directly into cinnamon sugar, into a paper plate thing, and then into my hands.  They were the best churros ever.

"ecjd11SUgmSa1arV-Sf17g","Corner Alley","Came here to hang out with a friend for a medical school mixer.  The place is nice, trendy, lively and loud.  Bowling mixed with drinking seems only natural, except this place makes it more upscale.  Coming from a Californian, the style and prices  compare pretty evenly to some of the stylish and lavish bowling alleys that have been around in my area for awhile.   The drink prices are comparable to upscale bar or nightclub levels which is always a turnoff but it's probably one of their main money makers.  Nothing here really set this place apart from other similar places I've been to and that's what made this place 3 stars for me.  Service was average, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Pros: Bowling, drinking, food? Sure why not.

Cons:  Pricey.

Overall: it's not a place I would come to often if I lived in the city.  Additionally If I travel back to the area I probably wouldn't come back here unless there was absolutely nothing else to do.  I'd rather just go bar hopping or drink somewhere else with friends.   Drinks are cheaper elsewhere and spending time with friends is what matters more to me.

The office is extraordinary clean and sanitary and they even have DVD glasses that you can watch while you are getting a long treatment. They also have chocolate chip cookies freshly baked for you on your way out of the office. They accept numerous types of insurance plans and do also have financing available if necessary. Dr. Sullivan has also been featured in the top 100 doctors in Phoenix metro area for many years now and one visit to his office you will quickly know why. The staff at his office make the experience of going to the dentist's office extremely bearable and pleasant. They are very accommodating when you need an appointment, they can find a way to sneak you in if it is an emergency. When setting an appointment, be sure to do so with plenty time notice, he is a very requested and respected doctor in the Gilbert community and may have a few week time line to get a regular appointment but you will be pleasantly surprised and will immediately know why.","2","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","1","3"

Place has a nice ambience, while having several tvs (if u r a sports/news fan,etc) Lots of attentive staff & really comfortable seating. They bring you tasty tortilla chips on the house, along with 3 salsas. My one peice of advice for people sensitive to spicy -Word Of CAUTION on the salsa brought with the chips. .the Orange salsa is on fire, I'm talking a spice level of 8/9. It is deceiving as their are really no visible spices in this one.  I didn't realize this ,it took my breath away literally & a whole glass of water to get it back. The steak quesadillas & chicken tacos were very tasty. I'm confident that all of their dishes are top quality, for sure what you want when you are going for Mexican food;p also gluten free &organic, without losing flavor. This is a new hidden gem which I hope is here to stay. Open 24 hours ,full menu& bar . This place also has a specific breakfast am menu as well.","1","2","2","1","1","2","2","3","3","2"
"ri2qVV9brqignxXYfyTTkw","Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse","And you thought Downtown Las Vegas was a place for cheap drinks, thrills, gambling and titty bars.

This place rivals most of the fine dining places on the strip and the pricing is actually very reasonable for the caliber of food. The portions are very large and the service is very fast and friendly. The atmosphere is dark and very intimate though there are spots in the middle perfect for casual dining, if you take your significant other then make sure you get a table along the walls of the place for an even nicer experience.

I would recommend a good cut of steak, the veal or the big 25 oz rib eye is the way to go. Pair it with a Pinot Noir and the lobster bisque soup. If you are not a meat fan ( you really shouldnt go to this place then ) but seriously if you just are not feeling steak then i would definitely get the jumbo shrimp and crab cakes.

I would definitely recommend this place, it is also a great last minute nice place to eat just in case you forgot to make plans or need a place to impress with little or no time advance or reservations.","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

We checked in, went up to the room they assigned us, and someone was already in it. Ok... So we go back down, explain to the manager that they gave us a room that was already occupied, and he assigns us a new one. Everything seems to be back on track, until we return from dinner the following night, get up to our room, stick our key in the door, and it doesn't open. Awesome. Again, we have to go all the way back downstairs to speak to another manager. He tells us that ""someone"" had switched us to another room in the system. Obviously without our knowledge. So the manager gives us $100 food and beverage credit for the inconvenience. Nice gesture, but it doesn't really make up for the heart attack I almost had thinking they had given our room away and someone made off with all our belongings.

"886xYzLtJEynrpNrLDlKJQ","Madison Avenue Pub & Restaurant","Fantastic place. Been frequenting the Maddie for a few years now, and it's the *variety* which always grabs me: a dance floor, pool tables, rooftop patios, a piano bar. Hold hands with strangers at 128 BPM. Sing along with new friends, gathered around live music. Get destroyed by semi-professional pool players.

Be aware that it's often crowded past midnight, and that it might take a while for your drink to get served. I've never actually had any issues with service (as some people have complained), I really think it's just too busy sometimes and I don't blame them. However, I find the claustrophobia and cacophony part of the experience -- one that I've grown fond of, actually.

As far as drinks go this place is a great place to go anytime of the year! (It has a retractable roof!!!!) The view and atmosphere are absolutely amazing, the only other comparable thing would be Biergarten at the Hotel Monaco.

The reason for the four stars is because even though the service and flatbread pizza we got were great the late night snack menu was seriously lacking. Being from out of town, maybe I overestimate Pittsburgher's appetite for a decent late night appetizer menu. I understand cutting costs by only offering flatbread pizzas, but having the choice of bruschetta or nachos or anything other than pizza would have been nice. That being said, the bacon and egg pizza with maple glaze we got was a solid decision and tasted like breakfast morning.

I like to try a place's Jambalaya or Risotto or Paella, I make sure to order Panang Curry at Thai places, and I'm a bit of a General Tso's Chicken addict. Thanks to Bobby Y's review, I knew I had to check out China One for some GTC action.

I went here with my Dad late one night. I wasn't all that hungry, so we ordered some fried rice to share. It was enough to feed and satisfy both of our appetites. The fried rice was pretty good, but a little on the oily side. Then again, I may have only noticed the oil because of the styrofoam plates we were eating on. The plates were absolutely covered in oil by the end!

As for the GTC, I got it to go. So yes, this is not a review of freshly cooked China One GTC. I took it to work the next day and had so much food, I split it up into lunch part one and lunch part two. Even reheated the next day, the GTC was solidly good eats. The vegetables weren't so fresh anymore, but I like the fact that it even comes with vegetables. My usual go-to GTC lunch destination is Chopstix; they don't include veggies, so this was a nice change-up.

I'll have to return for the lunch special GTC and eat in next time. Not that I was disappointed in the GTC - not at all. It was very good and worthy of returning, even though there are probably a ton of equally good places between my house and China One.","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","3"

"SRLFfJ2IPdws_K19tCPZ6w","Hair Artzy","I came here for a digital perm and as per the previous reviews I requested for Ricky. He did take his time and gave me a nice perm. I was there for about 5 hours. I definitely didn't expect it to take that long. My hair wash and rinse was very thorough, which is a definite plus. Personally I wished there was more volume. I asked for volume at the roots and he didn't set the rods on the scalp. They were rolled very loosely off scalp and I know that's how the typical digital perm is set, but I was hoping it would be done with volume. As a former hairstylist I understand the concept of how a perm should be wrapped to achieve that. Also, since the Perm solution was applied almost to the scalp, I was expecting the neutralizer to be applied there as well, but it was not. As for the styling it wasn't done to my liking, but that's no big deal. He's great at doing haircuts, though I'm not too sure how comfortable he is with doing perms and styling of the perm. It turned out fine and my hair is very healthy. I'm not sure I would sit for 5 hours again though. There are definitely faster ways to do a digital perm and have it turn out the same healthy way. I would recommend coming here. The work is on par with what I expect as a stylist.","1","2","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3"

But after the first night the experience changed to pain. Some type of insect in the room bit the crap out of my arm and ribs. I woke up with huge welts on my right side. I complained to house keeping who stated they would have engineering spray the room. When we returned I didn't smell the spray but I assumed they had done the job. My wife saw small bugs walking around in the bathroom. The second night the biggest bite happened on my arm. That was it. I complained to management and they moved us to a larger ""honeymoon suite"". Management had this nonchalant attitude, just said ""sorry about what happened"" and that she'll upgrade our room for our last night. Will update this later after seeing that ""upgrade"".

Here's the update. First, the manager actually tried to give us another night free in the same room with the bugs, showing she did not listen to our complaint initially. Secondly, stated that there wasn't any room available for another hour. At this time we already waited 2 hours beyond the time she promised earlier, ruined our plans for the day.

When i asked for my money back, a room magically became available. The room larger but it wasn't impressive.

Before the renovations the library was still stuck with interior from the sixties and seventies era, nothing too exciting and added to the atmosphere of 'I really don't want to be in here!'

However, now, with the majority of the makeover complete, the library has turned itself into a sleek, up to date facility, which makes you actually want to go in and work in the new brilliant surroundings! On the first couple of floors, there are new group hub seating areas, making the library a lot more accessible to groups of people who need to work and talk at the same time! On the fifth floor it's always a race in the mornings to get the best seats in the house! Stunning views await you on the fifth floor which makes for quite a nice distraction indeed! There is also a new Cafe on the ground floor which is all very modern but has got quite a limited range of foods!

The library is open primarily to registered students and staff of the University of Edinburgh. However, the library is also open to the public for reference use (Free!) and also for borrowing books (A fee is involved for this)! It is a fantastic facility with millions of books, computers, and laptop access points.

"Hqk1aX0EbGjQZ4Ztt0PaoA","International 88 Market","I think this place is pretty cool - if you're in the mood to make a homemade dish of Vietnam, India, or many other parts of the world, this place is your oyster. It really caters towards Asian and African cuisine so if you're in the mood for anything European you may not find it here and should call ahead.

We were able to purchase many items to cook Vietnamese food and the groceries, especially the veggies were CHEAP. For someone who normally shops at Sprouts for all my meals, I was super excited to see the same products or more for 50% less. I will definitely be coming here again and alternating between the two stores..but for any of my Asian needs, I'll be coming here without a doubt.

Cleanliness..well it was okay. It's no typical American grocery store but who cares, if you've ever been to Asia you'll see this place is way better than many stores even in the homeland. Everything is packaged and unopened so it really isn't a big deal if the linoleum floors need a little scrubbing in some places..but because of that reason I would say it gets a 4 out of 5 because there is some room for improvement.","2","2","3","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

The food is okay but pricey. Definitively better options around.

Machos biggest problem is its wait staff. Our server tonight, Nicole S., was more occupied on her phone with another table, getting simple requests would take 15+ minutes for her to complete especially since they were not busy at the time. She was definitely busy on her social media rather than her job. We were forced to tip her 18% because she refused to split the check.

The group of local people will not be coming back here. Maybe their next venture will be better or get new management.","1","3","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","3"
"aNQpzk6RFo1aRX9l-QVLWw","Atomic No 7","There is a certain level of excitement when told that you have full control over customizing your ice cream with no pre-made base. It is not Coldstone where you pick an existing ice cream base and add topics. No, you get to pick your milk, sweetener, and mix ins. You get to be the ice cream god! This can go either way and mine was mediocre.

I had got the raw base key lime pie with soy milk and stevia for a light treat. I was warned ahead of time that stevia adds an aftertaste that not everyone enjoys. I personally do not mind it, so I persevered. I take a certain amount of responsibility for the failure, but not all of it. I was going for a vegan treat that was low in calories because I have consumed far more than enough ice cream, gelato, or frozen yogurt to give me diabetes. The key lime was a really faint taste that leaves a lingering Sprite taste. I love key lime because it is bold and prevalent, so this was not impressive.

My friend got the yogurt base with regular sugar, coconut and blueberries. His was awesome. So the moral of the story is to not skimp on something you love. I ended up sharing my dessert and that rarely happens with ice cream.","3","1","1","1","3","3","1","3","3","3"

The food. I was there a few weeks ago, not super hungry, but meeting with a friend. Ordered the green bean tempura which was disappointing. Previously slightly overcooked green beans were dipped in tempura batter and deep fried, creating a dark, wet, limp bean in under seasoned crisp. Meh.

Went back last evening with a friend because the new garden bar (as opposed to salad bar) had arrived. Very disappointed. Additions seemed mostly dressing choices, some mixed seeds and a few other things that were not at all creative. Not bad, just undeserving of the promotional fanfare.

The ""back by popular demand"" biscuits, per the server, were laughable and in fact, that is exactly what I did. They were the size of a golf ball, cut in half.

After calling in the early afternoon to make a group reservation, I found out later that they are usually closed Sunday nights but the owner, Danny, was nice enough to stay open to accommodate our group. What followed was an impromptu sake tasting, stellar service, and some excellent dishes.

Plenty of good appetizers can be found on their menu like the creamy and rich Chawan mushi (egg custard with shrimp, chicken, and mushrooms), the well balanced Nasu dengaku (sweet miso glazed eggplant), or the crispy chicken karaage. But my favorite app was the salmon oshi sushi -- excellent, well seasoned rice topped with salmon and ikura.

For an entree, I went with the pork ginger don. Slice of pork with a prominent ginger flavor topped a massive amount of rice.

If you still have room for dessert, try the An'mitsu. The description of ""agar jelly, fruit, kinako ice cream and brown sugar syrup"" may not excite many, but it turned out to be an excellent dish, kind of like a more refined Halo Halo, where the ingredients are more cohesive.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3"

I love how my Baha Fish and Shrimp Tacos were both made when ordered. Toppings were both generous but I would just order 2 of those beer battered mahi mahi tacos instead of shrimp. Fish taco was surprisingly sizable and made a finger licking messy eat.

Food truck to a real restaurant and I think Gourmet Gringos Kitchen must be doing quite well. I remembered the first time I had their Mahi Mahi tacos at Nuit Blanche 2012 and they were amazing but the dine in fast food experience just feel so boring?!

It's definitely good, but I have to say that I prefer the Dor-Stop in Dormont for breakfast.

We went over the weekend.  Our service was great, as usual, everyone is very friendly.  I got corned beef hash (something the Dor-Stop is lacking), and it was alright.  It's hard to find really amazing corned beef hash - if you're ever in the Cleveland area and that's your thing, check out Big Al's.  Best I've ever had.

Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink.  You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.

Brisket is a specialty.  Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed.  They also do a sliced turkey.  Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.

Every single server who we came in contact with had a smile on their face & a pleasant voice. I asked one of the servers of he could recommend one of their red wines by the glass. He said he could & would be right back. He returned with 3 wine bottles, gave me tastes of each,  & allowed me to choose which one I preferred. I greatly appreciated this! I then asked about bread & he came back with the most amazing garlic knots! Oh wow! Lastly our meals were delicious. My cousin had the chicken marsala, which she said was wonderful & I had the cappollini pomodoro. The tomato sauce was full of flavor, not just tomato. Everything about our meal was completely satisfying. I cannot wait to go to their restaurant in Downtown Summerlin now!!! YUM!!!","1","3","3","3","2","3","1","2","2","2"

Service has been great no matter who we get.  Everyone's given a great show, and we make sure that we hit this place up every time we come into town.  The food is amazing, my hubby loves the sushi, but the BEST part of this place is the sauces they make.  This last time we went they had 5-6 sauces ranging from mild to flavor-filled spicy.  Every sauce was amazing and they cook them right on the grill in front of you.  This last time we found out they're open till early in the morning which is great when we come in late to Vegas and are hungry.  We HIGHLY recommend this place!!!! BEWARE...TON OF FOOD!!! LOVE IT!!!

One of the ladies that works there gave me some magazines and a juice box which I thought was super cute.

I got my hair washed, cut, dried, and styled (they ask if you want your hair straightened or curled) and it came up to $25 which is pretty decent! I am very satisfied with how my hair looks.

And when they brought it, we still didn't want to eat Terramisu, and he resisted to exchange it , even it was not touched. But the most disgusting moment was, that the waiter Max told me ""to give it to my friend if I don't want to eat. But he wont change it...""

We ordered Pani Puri, White Butter Chicken and the Meat Thali. Although we were the only people in the restaurant, the staff forgot to bring out parts of our order (such as the tea my partner ordered). Still they were friendly. I found their twist on the pani puris to be a little odd. The appetizer comes with three shots of different types of juice (""pani') that you pour into the puris. The serve yourself wasn't odd as much as the flavouring of the juice.

The mains are significant in portion. I've never had white butter chicken before, but I found it to be underwhelming in taste. A super filling, but mediocre dish. My partner had the Meat Thali. He seemed to enjoy most of the dishes on his thali. Overall, this place felt more gimmicky than authentic.

I always start with the combo caribe: tostones (fried green plantain slices), yucca fries (with an awesome salt and herb garnish) and maduros (fried sweet plantain). The dish is served with crema and jalapeño cilantro ranch. For empanadas I usually go with an El Capitan, a Boricua and a Cubana. Those three are my favorite go tos, I especially love the green olive, golden raisin and egg in the El Capitan. If I have room dessert the fig, cheese and caramel is to die for. The sweetness of the figs and warm caramel is balanced out by the mild saltiness of melty cheese; throw some powder sugar on top and it is awesome. Plus there's always friendly and quick service which is a huge plus. They can get pretty busy and even then the food times aren't too bad.

The appetizer (a hummus dip and olive dip) was strange and not what I expected,  I couldn't call it wonderful, but once again, it wasn't bad.  My wife ordered a frisco style burger and I had this grinder.  It was the worst sandwich I have ever had in my life.  I took one bite and I was done.  I have to admit the waitress (who was really nice and a good server too) kind of warned me that I might not like it, and I should have listened.

The seating arrangements are great with the long, communal tables and stools. If you find you are a bit stiff or need a comfy chair when you dine, it's probably not going to work the best for you.

There is a considerably large selection of meats you can choose from for $20!  We happen to go here by mistake.  We intended to go to the steakhouse next door but this caught our eye and we lucked out.  My wife made me eat the baby octopus.  It did not taste like chicken, I repeat IT DID NOT TASTE LIKE CHICKEN.  Whoever tells you that is full of it.  But it was good.  The meat portions aren't huge, which is good because you'll want to sample a lot of them.  And you really won't be able to try them all in a single visit.  You do all the cooking yourself.  We ended up paying $65 after two dinners, a couple drinks and a 23% gratuity.  The place has casual and open atmosphere.  It would be great to meet up with friends to have a great social time.

It's ironic then that buzz and lack of glamour are two of the most notable aspects of the shopping experience down here. It's a grand idea, a shopping centre in an area that's out of town yet not in the middle of a field like The Gyle or Silverburn, but somehow many of the shops are empty, and despite it's size and the presence of restaurants and a cinema, it feels eerily quiet and stagnant.

The bread was nicely toasted and the pork chop crispy. These places are hard to find nowadays. We had dinner here before and their dishes are okay, crab, lobster pretty standard but the four people meal sets are very economical.

Their burritos are the perfect mix of delicious, guacamole-filled heaven, with a crispy tortilla outside. You can pick whichever toppings you want to stuff them with. I'm a fan of the jalapenos or hot sauce -- but never together, my mouth has been on fire a couple times from that experience. They're grilled into a perfect little rectangle that kind of helps to prevent the huge mess that comes with burrito-eating. And a small one is about $7...not bad for a whole meal that you can fit in a tiny brown bag.

As everyone's said, lunchtime is CRAZY at both locations. They're right in the business district, not to mention steps away from tourist-y Queen St., so they experience a bit of an insane rush around noon. But it's so worth it.

They also have an interesting selection of craft beers and ciders--why shouldn't every morning start with a ginger beer?","1","2","2","1","2","1","1","1","2","1"

They have a happy hour so try and hit that as this is a Thai restaurant in the middle of Scottsdale and the prices do reflect that.  We did a few dishes from the hh menu and then ordered family style from the regular menu.  Pad Thai and pineapple rice were delicious as was the Panung Neur.  Really delicious flavors, but I do wish the dishes were a little larger. They offer take out as well and they have plenty of parking.","3","2","3","3","1","2","2","2","2","1"
"aOo7ctYjecAXxgZwbDyFHA","Pearl Aesthetic Perfecting Studio","Just amazing!  I got a gel pedi from Amanda (beach!) and it was just great!  She has such attention to detail...she spends a very adequate amount of time on each step.  You don't feel rushed through and she's a great conversationalist.

The studio is in an old Victorian House in the Mexican War Streets and is decorated impeccably.  As soon as you walk in, you know it's going to be time (and money!) well spent.

The toughest thing is making an appointment.  She's amazing so this isn't a walk in type of place...her clients return time and time again.  She's only one person and if she's with a client she devotes all of her attention to her client.  Leave a message!  She will call you back!  The best thing to do is to call right when she opens.

I made another appointment for a manicure at the end of my pedicure...I'm definitely going back!","2","3","3","3","2","2","1","3","3","2"

Thankfully, for a friends birthday, we came here for dinner! Our reservation group was quite large, 14-15 of us? Too big for 1 reservation so we did 3 reservations separately and that was fine, we all sat close enough we just shifted tables. The food was delicious! We had the pork bun, the big eye tuna with foie gras, oysters, pork ramen, chilled spicy noodles, Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes (shared between 3). It was just the right amount of food with a tremendous amount of flavor. Wine was ok, i don't think the food was meant for wine pairing.

My biggest complaint was this waiter / bus boy guy, not sure which he was, probably the ladder, but he gave us a weird look of discrimination and degrading demeanor. One of our friends had one too many glasses of wine, and he instantly went to a manager to tattle and they said they would call an ambulance for him if he didn't get up, so we were forced to have someone leave with him.

Overall the experience was great, minus the waiter / bus boy and our drunk friend.","1","2","3","2","3","2","2","2","2","2"

I ordered the chicken fried rice and my niece ordered the bento box. Two items on their lunch menu. I received my entree first and assumed my niece's entree would arrive shortly after. It arrived 15 minutes later. If you don't think 15 minutes is a long time, cook some rice and set it out and you'll learn it will be less than ideal. Not sure why they would not serve the food at the same time. I left a message with the front host to inform the manager to call me and I never received a call.  I will NEVER go back EVER.

We stayed on the strip, however wanted to take a trip to downtown.  Our Lyft driver made several food recommendations  but his main one was Pizza Rock.  He raved about the food and service.  Unfortunately we could not do the same.  We were seated immediately, sat down and the waiter came around asking for our drinks and order.  Since it was our first time, we asked for water and a few minutes to look over the menu.  We never got our water, however the table next to us got refills on their water.  We walked out after close to 15-20minutes, the place wasn't even busy for a Saturday night.  For us to not get a simple glass of water was no excuse.  I've tried to give downtown Vegas a break.

We had the crispy duck w/ greens, sea bass w/ drunken noodle, garlic shrimp, and mango & sticky rice. All which were extremely good I just couldn't get over the fact that those 4 dishes came out to be over $100 w/ tip. Not a big deal since we won enough money to pay for all 5 days meals & entertainment but DAMN! Was it worth it?? Yes but it definitely teetered near the edge of ridiculously overpriced, considering it wasn't on the strip in a fancy casino property (just carried the premium).

Well anyways, I'm glad we came since it was always on our ""to-eat-at"" list for Vegas. Maybe next time we'll try Kabol or Archies for Thai. I would come back to Lotus of Siam but probably with more people. Also, their wine list & glass enclosed racks were impressive. Something you'd rarely see in an Asian restaurant.

The banchan came out with the sundubu and kalbi which was disappointing since I was hungry and could have had something to chew on earlier. The server did not come by to check if I was ready for payment after leaving the bill with me and I had to prompt her by standing up after a while.

After 3 hours or so, Larry calls me and lets me know that my car was ready. Fortunately, my car didn't need any work so I was a happy gal. The inspections that they did were about $67 or so, which was pretty average as I had taken my husband to get the same thing done elsewhere.

I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I can't wait to go back.

I ordered veggie pad Thai with no peanuts...I start eating, and I bite down into something crunchy. Peanuts! You couldn't really tell what they were at first because it was all crunched up and mixed in well with all the other ingredients. They switched it out with no prob. Luckily, I didn't have an allergic reaction. But the the 2nd pad Thai had veggies that seemed not so fresh-almost sour tasting. I ended up just not eating it.

My friend ordered fried rice. Which was really good, until she found a long black hair in her food towards the end of the meal. Yuck. They took the dish away, (she was almost done anyway), took it off our bill, and offered to make more food for her to take to go.

The burrito was as good as I remember the al pastor at the Ahwatukee location. The marinated pork was tender with a slight amount of crispness along the edges. The flavor was deep, rich, earthy, with a tropical twist from the addition of pineapple. It was hearty and packed with meat, onions and sauce. The rice and beans were good too, and I was stuffed after eating half my meal. The total was a little less than $10. The order didn't come with any napkins or forks/knives in my to-go bag but since I was going straight home it was OK.

This location has a nicer layout and is newer so it's a definite winner for tasty Mexican food in Chandler.","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"

If you want to do the beer tour, finish earlier for optimal shirt size selection. They still do an IOU form and will call you when your size comes in, but it's nice to leave with your shirt. The management is also very helpful. When we first started doing the tours, we didn't know you could only drink 4 beers a night.

I mean, it's not because I never wanted to, but because I'd only ever heard rumour of its existence, and people never tended to elaborate on what they served there. They just tended to see you gotta get there early, or there won't be any ingredients left. So, one day, I did.

Greens Deli is the typical kind of student foody place to go. It's right next to the George Square library and the other abominable buildings that the university has built around George Square, and where it educates its students. This means that around 1, the place is packed with really hungry kids.

The fillings are really delicious, and the price is OK for how good it is. I don't know of any other sandwich place that has roasted courgettes AND aubergines AND peppers as fillings. And the honey mustard sauce is delicious. One warning, though. If you go here and decide to take your panini or wrap out to the park to eat (or wherever), be careful or you definitely will get covered in sauce.","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","3","3"

GRANTED, the only complaint I have (and it seems to be quite common to all locations), is that everything looks and feels sticky. I wish someone can just scrub the heck out of the tables and floors and chairs.

We went to Chili's mainly because they have a Cheap Bites menu that's served all day on Sundays (and we sat at the bar area because I dont' know if this is only for bar patrons). They are also avaliable during the week as ""happy hour"" deal and ""late night"" after 9pm.

$4.99 and you get pretty much a full size order. My favorite item on the $4.99 menu is Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The portion is insane, plenty to share. I asked for honey-lime dressing instead of ranch.

While I'm not a big chain diner, I do find Chili's to have good food for great price. $25 to feed 4 people is a good deal!","1","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3"

They do not own up to their mistakes nor do they have an action plan when they are wrong. This is not the way you conduct business. A manager by the name of Rachel should really think about retraining herself and staff on the proper way to deal with customers. I have learned that everything that glitter isn't gold. I was interested in this particular property because of this location and overall it's cheap monthly rate. After going through the runaround with them I'm glad my paperwork was lost or filed somewhere and they were unable to reach back to me after a month with the decision if I had a move-in date or not. There was a system error on their part they did not take ownership of that nor was I given any apology or at least a refund of money to show true gratitude towards customers. At this point this customer was right. I would never recommend this complex to anybody ever. Lastly I was informed that I cannot file a formal complaint to the owner because they do not take those kind of calls, if this is true this is poor business practice on their part.

Ever try to get near a T&T in Markham on the weekends? So not happening.

T&T price wise is eclipsed by Foody Mart and Tone Tai. You can find Bahn Mi here but they seem to sell out Saturday and there aren't any left by Sunday. The lunch counter is actually a great deal. 4 items (plus rice and soup) for what you'd pay for a combo meal at McDiggles. Srsly. There's rarely seating in the T&T's small food court area but you're steps away from the mall's food court proper. No probs taking it out there and just mowing down.

Where to pay for the take out food is a little confusing, however. There's no cash at the take out counter. Eventually we figured out you had to just get in line at a regular cash and pay for it.","3","1","2","2","2","1","2","3","2","2"

"N4V6JpV3xyNWt0paJOaKWA","Nora Shawarma","The shawarma at this place is great. But just the meat. the sandwich and the plate both come with salad that has this way-too-tangy zesty italian dressing on it that i don't care for. But, the meat makes the sandwich. I work nearby, and this is a pretty typical lunch stop for me. I can say the consistency is pretty good.

The thing that makes the meat so good is how they make it crispy. I love when the meat has a bit of charred crispy exterior. some of the best shawarma i've had has that quality. and the meat here is always fresh. they have a constant influx of customers.

i've never tried the other stuff they've got there but some of it looks pretty good. i'll have to try the kebobs one of these days. But I don't know.. i'm kind of a regular order kind of guy.","1","1","2","1","2","2","3","2","1","2"

The food is so good, it's one of those places that when you go in, you and your friends talk about the first time you went to such a great place. First of all the plates are huge, if your a true mountain of manliness, such as myself, you'll be able to finish your meal. Unless your dating a girl who really likes her food, your girl will probably be taking stuff home with her. In addition to quantity is the quality, the food is really indescribably good.

This is the quintessential mom and pop shop, as Johnny and his wife are the only employees. They are really nice people and it's nice to support such an establishment on principle.

The only bad part is that the hours are crappy, but from a place with literally 2 people, what do you expect?","3","2","2","3","1","3","2","1","3","2"

It wasn't busy and our waitress was inattentive.. Or maybe just poorly trained.  We had to ask for our waters and they were never refilled.

I tried the mama's trio which was extremely disappointing.  The fettuccine Alfredo was the best thing on the plate (which is handedly the easiest thing to make), the chicken parmigiana was burnt and the lasagna was on par with Chef Boyardee [to be generous].

We were rushed through the entire beginning of our meal.  Then, we waited about 20 minutes before getting the bill.  We planned to get cappuccinos and dessert but decided against it after that.","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3"

There aren't many restaurants in the city that focus on Canadian heritage, let alone are able to put a modern spin on the cuisine with an extremely fulfilling outcome! As a Canadian, it kind of warmed my heart! I had never even heard of most of the items on the menu so I knew I had to go.

We had two cocktails, four entrees and two desserts. The cocktails were balanced, refined and prepared meticulously. I've rarely seen entrees presented so beautifully. We all know you eat with your eyes first and Boralia hit a grand slam. Elk, ham, squab and bison. Cooked perfectly with a pink and tender middle, with a salty and crispy skin, I love squab. More squab please.

The desserts were yummy. Nice to finish with a sweet thing but the entrees were where this place surely did shine.","3","2","3","3","3","1","3","3","3","3"
"S-8j5u372B_1cJsCFeimhg","ADOT","Compared to Durango, Colorado, both the Sun City, AZ and Scottsdale DMV offices licensed my car and also issued a drivers' license, with a high degree of professionalism and integrity.

Unlike the Durango, Colorado DMV who called the police to escort me out of their office, because they claimed I was asking too many questons, both the Sun City and Scottsdale offices took extra time to answer my questions, and were very patient, as were the folks behind me in line.

Since my home state of Washington now refuses to renew my car and drivers license over the internet, then it is nice that Arizona can do this.  Colorado, has similar policies, politics, and problems as Washington and also New Mexico; all three states need to learn from Arizona that they are essentially violating the 4th amendment by requiring intimate, personal information when issuing vehicle registrations and drivers licenses. They're also probably violating the interstate commerce clause. Freedom of mobility among all 50 states should not be blocked by legislatures in states run by the Democrat party, and that said, I'm young, but am essentially an old fashioned JFK Democrat who favors both civil liberties and low tax rates (i.e. essentially the same as a Ronald Reagan Republican)!","2","1","3","2","3","2","2","2","3","3"

The tour guide told us that they removed an entire row from the bus so customers can have more leg rooms.  The bus was chartered from MegaBus so it had onboard Wifi both in Canada and in the USA and also had power outlet in every seat.  Our bus initially had some WIFI issue and the tour guide was telling the customers that we might be switching to another bus because of it.  This was very unexpected from a Chinese company and it's good service.

The tour guide was very professional.....a bit too much talking.  Talked about every city that we pass by.    As always with these Chinese tour, it's always ""see as much in as little amount of time as possible"".  We visited 4 cities in 4 days and it felt very rushed.

Also, the price is unbeatable.  We stayed at Hilton hotels for 3 nights(of course not prime location), but it's very comfortable.","3","2","3","3","1","3","2","3","1","2"

The interior of the venue has the trendy decor of a wine bar with plenty of booth and bar seating. The outdoor patio is softly lit and kept cool with numerous misters. The music is modern and upbeat and just loud enough to be heard over the cacophony of conversations that will certainly surround but should not overwhelm you.

On to the food! The half sandwich/half salad deal is perfect for lunch or a light dinner. I tried the chicken and mozzarella sandwich and the raspberry chicken salad--both were sumptuously scrumptious! The salad was a perfect blend of greens and nuts and chicken and fruit. The sandwich was a fantastic compilation of tender chicken, fresh mozzarella, soft bread, and just the right amount of spicy mayo.

We did and he was absolutely right. How he could tell that from 3 lanes away with the windows rolled up, I don't know - but I'm happy that he has psychic taco finding skills.

Hands down, Tacos El Pastorcito has the best al pastor in Vegas. I've been across the city from the chain stores to the street-corner taquerias whose menus aren't even in English. This place ranks at the very top. Yes, it's on a street corner in the parking lot of a tire shop -- BUT it has an ""A"" rating from the heath inspector (most mobile kitchens are ""B""s at best). Yes, it's in a ghetto part of town, but it's 30 seconds off the freeway, so suck it up, jump off the 96 and risk your personal safety for 5 minutes while you pick up some of the best tacos in Vegas.

The carne asada is worth the risk and the al Pastor will make you completely forget that you are surrounded by drunken creepers staggering home from Fremont Street.

CONS:  For a place that NEVER used to charge, they've gone to charging men and NOW women after 9PM. There is nothing different about this place, so why the cover charge?  They also put in cheap leather looking booth seating with a cheesy sign for VIP/Bottle service. There is nothing VIP about this place other than just being able to have a designated place to sit.

Because they don't answer the phone, the only way to get supplies is to go down there without an appointment. Today was the last straw when a new employee told me until I gave her my credit card she wasn't ""going to waste time"" helping me with the order. (quite ironic since they have wasted countless number of hours of my time with being on hold and not-returned calls) She cited this as a new policy. They treat patients like they loath them or its all charity. Its not  -  My supplies cost easily more than $2,000 a year.

Very interesting and tasty twist on the spicy scallop handroll (my favorite), nice little sesame vibe, no mayo, and a perfect level of spice (tingle on the lips without full on tears).  Salmon skin roll and albacore were both good, and the unagi was surprisingly awesome (right off the broiler too, none of that cold mushy stuff they give you sometimes).  Spicy tuna wasn't spicy enough but still good fish.  Sushi chefs were great - the yellowtail was the chef's personal favorite and while ordinarily not something I eat, this stuff was YUM.  Finished off with the tempura red bean ice cream - good but I think I like red bean mochi better.  But still a nice ending.  Lemon drop cocktail was good as well. Only surprise?  No sunomono on the menu, boooo.  But if I am ever in Vegas again (which I doubt as I am not a fan, just here on business), I'll definitely be back.

We got the BEST seating outside, directly under the speakers that were playing the BEST 80's songs.  We had so much fun guessing artists and song titles while drinking in the shade. The beer flight there is a STEAL! You pretty much get to try every beer (I don't recall the exact number) and for a great price (I don't recall the price either, sorry!). They also have chilled Fireball just WAITING for you to shoot.

The best part for me was complimenting our server on what a great job she was doing, only to find out that she's actually a busser! She said our original server got too overwhelmed with his other tables so she had to take over our table.  I was just in awe that someone with such little serving knowledge gave me one of the best dining experiences that I can recall.  I wish I could remember her name but CBC I hope you promoted her to be a server!!

I highly recommend the hot wings as well.  If you're gonna go big and get beer and Fireball -ya gotta get hot wings.  We tried their 'death sauce' or whatever they call it - basically the hottest of the hot. But being hot sauce connoisseurs it wasn't anything we couldn't handle.

Not a complete bargain.  I saw a few things that I liked but still thought the price was too high on some items especially when they're at a discount surplus store. You can find lots of odds and ends here, a bit of a crowded frazzled store a few holiday items, crafts, bed coverings, housewares, decor, outdoor garden items, lamps, some furniture and a few clothing items.

"7XO8kxi26vOCQZZt40k7Hw","A'Pizza Badamo","I got the eggplant hoagie and a pepperoni pizza $27.  The eggplant hoagie comes wrapped in butcher paper.  I thought I was in for a tasty crispy eggplant sandwhich.  Not!  It was slimy!  I like my eggplant, zucchini, and okra fried with a crispy cornmeal coating.  The sauce is salty and does not compliment the eggplant.  The bread was toasted and that was the ONLY crunchy part.  I had a sweater full of crumbs.  The cheese is thick and goey.  I liked the cheese, but, No Way would I order the eggplant sandwhich again.  I give it a (1).

The pizza is not bad.  I give it a (3).  It is better than Mineo's.  The crust is tough.  The sauce is that same salty sauce used on the eggplant, but it plays better on pizza.  The cheese was plentiful, thick, and goey.  They don't skimp on the cheese.  I like the chese.  I'm picking at it while I write this review.  The pepperoni pieces are small so that helps when biting.  It tastes like Hormel out of a package.

The shop is SO hot and humid in July.  I recommend you take a 15"" walk and come back when your pizza is ready.  I feel sorry for the staff that has to stand on top of a hot oven all day.  They were very friendly though.

I STRONGLY recommend you go in the public parking lot across the street to park $1.50.  The meter men make a killing up and down W.Liberty/Washington Ave.  The parking lot is full too.  I had to park on the 3rd floor.","3","1","2","2","3","2","2","3","3","3"

I got an apple cider toddy drink which was probably the perfect level of cozy for October!

Sometimes the service can be a little sassy, but it does get pretty busy here at certain times. Tricky because the lineup area isn't really great for having a line that's +5 or 6 people without getting crowded and confusing.

Yep, there it was at the very end, next to State Farm. The SIGN WASN'T ON!!! All the other business, even though they weren't open yet had their signs lit! So, if you're looking, it's in the strip mall behind Chik fil A.

Now, the donuts were absolutely worth the extra effort! They had a good selection of fresh donuts so we bought a dozen to try several varieties. They will fill long johns and round donuts while you wait, with one of several choices of filling. They put a nice amount in there compared to the local donut chains. We liked the chocolate filling the best. The cinnamon twists were also great. All of the varieties they had were made from raised dough, better than KK because they had more substance. IF they also made Old Fashioned Cake Donuts, they would be perfect! The staff was friendly & helpful. I now crave these donuts!","3","3","2","3","2","2","3","3","2","3"

We told him what he wanted for dinner (chicken and shrimp) but he failed to write it down so we just got an extra app. Not a dinner!

The performers use the whole auditorium so don't feel bad if you are sitting far away. Also yes this show is a cirque but since it commemorates MJ there is A LOT of dancing. The show is kinda pricey but worth every penny.

I went to a local mechanic to get it checked out and was informed that the blower motor was dead and would need to be replaced. The mechanic recommended I contact a Kia dealership and see if the motor would be covered by warranty since the car was still under 60,000 miles.

I took my chances and went to Findlay Kia to see if they could help me on such short notice. I arrived at approximately 1 pm on a Friday and they were dead. I spoke with Mike, who was a total sweetheart and extremely helpful. He advised they would take a look at the car and see what was wrong. In total, it took about an hour and a half for them to check the car out and order the part. Mike advised me that he would give me a call in the morning once the part arrived. Sure enough, 8:30 am the next morning, Mike called me and it had arrived. I got to Findlay Kia around 10:00 am and was out of there by 11:00.

Not only were they quick and thorough, but the customer service was excellent. They washed my car for me, and the warranty covered everything. And not once while I was there did Mike try talking me into purchasing any other services, which I appreciated.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

It is important to note that this place is slightly out of the way (wexford is a good 20-30 min drive depending on traffic), and  serves American Chinese food and authentic Szechuan food.  My parents come from out of town not to see me, but for this food (particularly the green beans).  :)  Okay, maybe a bit of both.

If you want real Szechuan food, ask for the real, Chinese menu.  Otherwise all you will get is the american chinese menu (if you are not Chinese).  It's a short menu, but full of some good stuff.  Get the noodles (under appetizers), phonetically pronounced Dan-dan (as in ""Hahn"") mein, the green beans, and the fish.  Yum!  But pretty much all is good.

Hubby and son shared the full rack of ribs with loaded baked potato and house salad with ranch. My eldest daughter chose the chicken with smothered cheddar and bacon with fries.

"lp8ImFz2tAsygNnSpGt0Eg","Fat Pasha","Food is good here. Couple of reasons for the two stars...

1. Lack of pita: ordered a trio of dips and it came with four tiny pita chips. Asked for more pita chips almost instantaneously (because you know when you have literally a full plate of dip and four chips the ratio isn't quite right), and of course, charged for the ""extra order"" of pita. Ludicrous. Poor business sense. Although the charge was only $1.50, it just rubs me the wrong way, you know? If it's only $1.50 why don't you add that to the cost of the original dish and provide an adequate amount of pita chips to start with.

2. Ordered some main dishes and two soups to start. Main dishes came first, soups came last. A bit odd? We thought they had forgot about our soups and had to ask if they were still coming...","2","3","2","3","2","2","2","3","3","3"

My wife had the tortellini which was great.  Other peoples' orders included fettuccine, gnocchi, and penne (all great).  We also ordered their ravioli as an appetizer and it was some of the best ravs I've ever tried!

Pretty poor considering drinks are usually the first thing you get and a restaurant can make lots of money!

The dish our group was most impressed with were the cod fish tacos. Little nuggets of succulent cod were lightly fried, gently rucked in flour tortilla shells, arrived with a hidden delightful jalapeno mayo surprise within.

""Bravo, Wendy's! Bravo!""

Both of our masseuses were phenomenal! I had Roy who has a very warm and upbeat personality.  He made me feel relaxed from the moment I met him. And his hands..... truly amazing.  My body is still in awe. My husband had Nia and she was able to relieve an old shoulder injury.

The massage rooms were nice but a bit small. The music was very relaxing. And the oils used had a very nice scent and were very moisturizing as well.

Here are the bad parts. The front desk staff are quite snobby. It's very obvious they are not people persons. They could at least paste on a fake smile while greeting clients. They did nothing at all to try to make us feel welcomed or appreciated.  Also, the champagne is quite horrendous, even for a complimentary glass.  We also tried some tea that was quite bland. Being a high end and expensive place of business they should offer a more high end beverage.

1. Food: We ordered a variety of dishes.  The biggest disappointment was the pasta! A kid could make it better, to be honest.  It was beyond bland, lacked any flavor and not even served hot.  Olive Garden serves better pasta and you can buy a grocery store pasta sauce that is much, much more flavorful.  This came as a shock as this is the Giada's restaurant!

2. Service: Incredibly slow.  We waited over ONE HOUR for our entrees to be served! No waiter came to give us any updates. Once they did arrive, a few dishes were not even warm.  We ordered 2 cocktails which took so long to serve that we finished eating our meal in that time. After no word from them about our drinks, we inquired about them only for the to remember. We proceeded to tell them to just cancel it because we were already ready to pay our bill and leave.  After he acknowledged that, a few min later, someone came running with our drinks...probably so they could still charge us for them.  But we again told them no, we already cancelled them because we are done eating now.

Overall, very disappointing experience.  If you want good Italian food, do not come here.  However, if you want average/below average but to be in a place with beautiful ambiance and views, then come and enjoy your time here.","3","3","2","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"

It's a little hidden on Notre-Dame, it's basically a red door _ I was confused for a bit until I saw someone else walk in.  Talk about sight overload - but in a good way!  Everywhere you look is a bit kitsch - but in the best way possible!  bird cages hanging from the ceiling, cool art work, the bar with cool little figurines.  Everywhere you look is something interesting to be looked at!

Since I was eating later on as well I only wanted a small bite - so I ordered their papaya salad and their steam bun with marinated tofu.   The salad was tangy and tart and fresh and spicy - a great combination of flavours!  The steam bum was delicious (there is a pork version as well but I don't eat pork so opted for the tofu version).  It was marinated well - not too salty as I find with most marinades.  It hit the spot and definitely tided me over until my next food spot.  I was impressed as well that the food came out quick and the servers came over to make sure it was to my liking.  I believe everything on the menu has a spicy kick - perfect for me!

This is definitely a winner for me - I'll be back here for sure.  I believe there is another location - a small stall in one of the markets - Atwater market I believe).

Although, on nights when big celebs make an appearance the promoters can't even get you in.

The business is new and I understand we all need to catch our flow, the food however made up for the wait! We had the chicken karaage, nishikawa curry and black... And WOW.

There is a star in both of these, and that's the little jar on the table with the garlic chili flakes! You must put in your soup.

My only complaint would be that we felt rushed by the waitress. We hadn't even finished our meals & she was trying to take our plates away & plonked the cheque down.

They are very affordable compared to others around town, considering the level of expertise and care. They are not looking to make a quick buck they are very caring and honest. I would reccomend them to anyone who loves thier pet.","2","3","2","3","2","2","3","3","1","2"
"xzcakFjHGeDk-AEITikDvA","Sushi Bong","I stayed at the hotel the Liberty Suites, decided to walk around the shopping plaza behind the hotel, and came upon Sushi Bong. I was in the mood for sushi, so I stopped inside.

The place is tiny, and I think they cater to more takeout than anything else. However, I dined there, and it was comfortable. I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, a rainbow roll, a california roll, and some seafood udon soup. I was really hungry, but it was a LOT more food than I expected it to be. The soup was really good, and filling. Nice and hot, perfect for a cold winter day. The sushi was decent. They keep the menu relatively simply, and they do it well, at a very reasonable price.

I will definitely come back ;)","2","1","3","2","1","3","2","3","2","2"
"iNLA_NmCM5cW9Ywiz8040g","Tony and Tina's Wedding","To sum it up, it was like going to some random person's train-wreck of a wedding. They try to make you feel like you're at a friend's wedding; they have actors coming up and talking to you but you pretty much just want them to go away. This one actor asked me to dance; I told him I didn't want to and he made me anyway and then told me I looked like I was in high school, that I had a cute baby face, and that I wouldn't have a hard time finding a job because my major was employable. I didn't pay money for his opinions about me. After that, we ate and the food was okay. The same actor came up to me later and told me to dance more and asked me who I had to impress. Excuse me. Then later, he made me and my sister get up for the boquet toss (I mean, what if you don't want to participate?). We had a fake-drunk actor at my table, how random. He kept mumbling while I was trying to eat my cake.

DONT waste your money.","2","2","2","2","2","1","1","3","3","2"
"nen-zDUorGGXCb28NmEo6g","Coco's Restaurant","Five of us went to this restaurant only because it was close to the Tropicana hotel.  There were 2-3 waittresses working and the restaurant was not busy but service was SLOW.  One of us had to get up and ask for coffee refills.  Someone wanted to order crepes but the waittress said they were out but blinzes are available.  So that means the crepes are frozen and not fresh!  I am not expecting alot from Coco's but crepes are made with about 3 ingredients and the cooks can't make them from scratch?  The food we did eat was bland and dry.  If I could give it zero star or 1/2 star, I would.","2","1","3","2","2","2","2","3","1","2"
"9piCcvnKWRtHeJ27BOQeJw","Canaletto","Just stopped here as my final meal out in Vegas.  I love the Venetian, so I decided to grab a bite somewhere inside so I can enjoy the fake scenery and pretend I was actually in Venice.

I forget the name of the dish I had but it was linguine w/ a mix of seafoods. It was excellent! I only wish it didnt fill me up -- I was eyeing up the gelato stand in the middle of St. Marks Square.

I'd recommend you go here since the food is pretty decent , it's semi romantic, and the prices aren't half bad.","2","1","2","1","3","3","2","1","2","2"
"kERJIKglAhVmOxejEYJw6A","StripSteak","Good but not life changing like I expect a $350 dinner for two should be. For the price of dinner I expect a higher level of service. Service where plates are brought to you and whisked away or wine is refilled in a blink of an eye without you even noticing. The Tomahawk Wagyu steak for two was flavorful and well cooked but a a bit on the fatty side even for me. I felt the wine bottle selection had very little variety in the sub $100 range. When we have a tv placed right above the table, mistake in my opinion and should be at bar only, I'm not ordering that $200 bottle of wine and second guessed my $165 steak.

With all the amazing steakhouses out there I doubt I'll come back.","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2"
"eHlsOGuMGlzpsFnj5pUIZw","The Garage Bike Shop","My commuter bike was in serious need of a tune up/overhaul after 5 years.  Shifting, brakes, wheel bearings, were in bad shape.  Renee was friendly and very accommodating and promptly gave the bike a thorough check over and diagnosis while I was there.  He completed a full tune up and overhaul of wheel and bottom bracket bearings and had the bike ready in a couple of days, despite having to deal with flooding in his shop from the heavy rain.  When I came to pick the bike up Renee's wife was very friendly and went over what was done.  The bike had evidently been thoroughly cleaned and looked great.  It rides actually better than new:  gear changes are quick, no more chain rubbing, brakes are adjusted just right. The price for all this work was very reasonable and I feel like I got a great deal.  I'll definitely come back.","3","2","3","3","1","2","2","3","3","2"
"iZPl5XxZv9W4WGK7-Ys_HA","Makino Sushi & Seafood Buffet","My friend, Ryan recommended place when we were trying to figure out where to eat before heading back to Cali. I was craving my philly roll so I was all for sushi, especially if it's AYCE!

Came here, got seated right away and the waitress took our drinks order right away. I went to the sushi side first, I was looking for my philly roll but they didn't have it. I was so bummed... I tried a few of the other sushi that they had, they were average - nothing special. The other side they had a variety of Japanese food from Udon soup, to shrimp tempura, to fried rice, and of course desserts.  My favorite were the shrimp tempura and the dumplings. The sauce for the dumplings was so good, the spiciness was just perfect! I loved their miso soup dispenser, haha!

This is a good AYCE sushi spot for around $20 and you get more than just sushi. I can't say anything about their desserts, I end up not being able to save room for desserts, I care more about the real food. haha! I had 3 full plates and I left the restaurant happy not feeling too full.  :)

*Service - They refilled our water a little too often, but better than not at all","1","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","3"
"9ISZhCjisjmIpINkfVDkHg","Target","I always go to this target since I live down the street. I bought a pair of twenty dollar sweatpants today and got home to realize they are too small. I go to find the receipt but it seems to have been thrown away by accident. I look at an old target receipt and on the back it states that returns and exchanges can be done without a receipt and a valid id. Ok cool, so I head down grab a better size and go to exchange. The lady tells me that since the pants we're on sale at SOME point in the last thirty days she can only refund me fifteen dollars. Meaning I get to pay five extra dollars if I want a different size. I did I literally night then an hour ago, she says I have no way to prove that. She was nice about it and felt bad, but how in the hell can they get away with charging me 25 dollars for a pair of 20 sweats? As long as I'm not asking for money back who cares about an even exchange?","3","1","1","1","2","2","1","2","3","2"
"-grSvaH5qWD3yn4NiLT3tg","Malones's Bakeries","Malones is a bakers located on Slateford Road in Edinburgh. As far as I'm aware, this bakery mainly supplies other shops and hotels etc rather than concentrating on its own shop. The best thing about Malones is that it is open late at night to get everything ready for delivery the next day so it's a great stop off on the way home from a night out. Malones is the place to go if you find yourself slightly drunk at midnight and need a yum yum and a sausage roll! Its pretty well priced but not as cheap as Greggs and doesn't have the selection either.","1","2","2","1","2","2","2","1","2","1"
"RF7zy-XMzDsUaCa5zq33Vg","Ernie's Restaurant & Bar","Seven of us went to Ernie's for a Christmas karaoke tradition. It's a nice place with a huge selection of all kinds of music and Karaoke seven nights a week. Everyone in our group who wanted to sing got at least one opportunity and there was even some dancing going on. My only complaint is that the PA system was way too loud, which made it hard to hear the singers and also made my ears ring. I kept stepping into the hallway to get out of the sound waves as they were actually painful. We all had fun while we were there, but left early and decided we probably won't go back because of the excessive decibels.","2","3","2","3","2","1","2","3","2","2"

The bartender came back in a matter of a couple of minutes with a side...he ran next door to Linger to grab her some sour cream.  Talk about high touch service.  I also love every time the owners are here that they recognize me, say hello and stop to chat for a few! Heads up taco lovers, They let us know about Cinco tomorrow and how they are doing $1.50 tacos  and happy hour ALL day...I might be back tomorrow","2","1","2","1","2","3","2","2","3","3"
"asaA3l3YlSVKm84QD-xvNQ","Don Pedro Mexican Restaurant","Man, it's a hard job discerning good from bad when it comes to Mexican food.  Good thing I have a place like Don Pedro to help benchmark 'good'.  This place is much like the run of the mill Mexican eatery but the finishes are just a tad bit of an upgrade in relation to most.

The service is great and attentive.  We were there on a Sunday and there were a couple VERY large parties of people being taken care of so they know how to deal with larger groups.

Table side guacamole on tap too is a definite bonus.  He'll make it spicy too!  I like that.","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"
