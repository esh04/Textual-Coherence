Are we in a good place to begin paperwork to bring Jen Davis up here on TDY in October?

If so, I would recommend we ask her to report on October 29 and I will get the EX office to start the paperwork. She will be detailed to us for 90 days, which will enable her to receive funding for housing, meals + incidentals, etc., and this 90 day period will carry her through the end of the term on January 20, 2013. This schedule would give me 10 days or so of consultation before a desired departure for Vienna on November 14.

I am not intent on rushing out to Vienna; the closer we get the more there is to be done, and we may not get ourselves ""packed out"" before we depart (not a wholly unwelcomed outcome, since we can set aside that task for December or January). But, if the elements are in place, Carol and I would like to go out mid-November in order to participate in IAEA meetings on November 26-30.

My swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for November 9 at 10am on the 8th floor. Whatever plan we embrace, that date is set and Carol and I are eager for the day.","3","2","1","2","2","2","3","1","2","2"

The Ravens Group has a consistent and strong track record in government services.

I've sought to have the Gens meet Under Secretary Kennedy. I don't know if my requests have made it to him... We know of specific opportunities State is seeking and we know that there are some timely opportunities, too.

You will see below some lower level work outreach that has taken place at State... But there are more opportunities than just those mentioned below...

I'd love the opportunity for our Gens to come in for appropriate meetings, which seems to be Under Secretary Kennedy. I think, while lower level outreach is going on, having this top level meeting would be invaluable for State to know and be aware of a govt contracting group with the best possible scores, results, status and cost saving measures...

Dear Hillary,

You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm, Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior and respected Generals from the PLA.

The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the 22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be valuable.

I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.

See below for Raj's follow-up — it's highly ironic, of course, but nevertheless strong and good stuff. I also wanted to note that USAID is already presenting a new face around town; Jose Fernandez and I were on a QDDR panel at CFR two weeks ago with Michael Kremer— having Michael be the USAID representative simply speaks volumes for their ability to be a thought leader and real player in the development community, as does Steve as their chief economist.

In general, it is code for ""After so much cost and so many losses and so many bombs in our cities, the Americans are telling us we're still not doing enough."" This negative interpretation is used by the PakMil to convince Pakistanis that the U.S. is a malign influence and to avoid taking the steps we seek.

We avoid literally using the words ""do more;"" but Do not hesitate to specify what we want them to do; and Let's push back on this view: We acknowledge their contributions and their losses — and we are helping.

Although I regretfully missed seeing you on your swing through Beijing earlier this year, I will be back in Washington on July 30. Would love the opportunity to meet with you briefly and give you up update on my thoughts/ insights into China and the rest of the region. The story is not quite as neat as it appears on the surface. Despite all the hype, this region remains an export machine that should struggle in the aftermath of the crisis -- with important implications for many of the global economic issues you are facing. I have had extensive meetings throughout the region over the past few months and would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a first hand assessment.

One other note: I will be publishing a book in Sept! Oct, ""The Next Asia"", which digs beneath the surface of many of the macro issues the region faces. It is generally constructive on the Asian outlook but lays out a number of critical milestones that must be hit to validate the hopes and dreams of the ""Asia Century."" I have asked the publisher (Wiley) to send you an advance copy of the manuscript in the hope you or your staff might find it of interest.

Hope to hear back from you on the feasibility of meeting later this month.

"C05764521_2","","Jake,

I wanted to update you on two aspects of our work leading up to the September session at the UN Human Rights Council where the U.S. will be a full member for the first time: 1) freedom of expression (addressed in this email) and 2) human rights strategy at the UN (in a second email on high side).

First, I'd like to let you know about the successful next step in a strategy we are pursuing at the UN Human Rights Council to begin to change the dialogue on Freedom of Expression. We think we have developed a well-balanced text that we can move forward to adoption in the UN HRC's September session. This work contributes to our long-term effort to improve this UN body. Progress on this issue would help us later as we address the even more difficult issue of the ""defamation of religions"" about which the Secretary expressed interest in a Monday senior staff meeting.

An 10-DRL-L-NEA group has been working together to implement the strategy that involves reaching agreement with the Egyptians on a text that we will roll out late next week with countries in the OIC (Organization of the Islamic Conference) and the WEOG (Western European and Other Group, our regional group at the UN).

Experts in L, DRL, 10, and NEA agree that the text protects all USG red lines and offers us a workable compromise that can secure genuine cross-regional consensus when presented in the Human Rights Council in September, hopefully avoiding a divisive vote on this issue. US and Egyptian teams also agreed to the possibility of further cooperation in the UNGA to come to a soft landing on defamation of religions if Cairo and Washington first succeed in passing the FoE resolution by OIC/WEOG consensus.","2","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","2"
"C05769049_2","","The latest regarding border issues:

a) Per EmbOff, border at Jimani remained disorganized but functional as in recent days.

b) The flow of persons across the border is constant, but no mass influx. However, official figures under-report the numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are sneaking across the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report ""tens of thousands"" leaving Port-auPrince, some for the DR border. However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry attempts in the mountains around the Jimani crossing.

c) A Haitian immigration official said that as of lpm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue being allowed in.

d) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on the Haitian side began demanding ""manifests"" from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR officials managed to talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal. (Note: It is unclear whether this was an attempt at rent-seeking by the Haitian official, but some reporting implied that. End Note).

e) As the next Market Day in Jimani will be Thursday, efforts are already underway to see if market activities that day can be organized so as not to block/hamper through-put of assistance / evacuation vehicles.","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","2","1","2"

"C05771747_0","","Please Pass to the Secretary

Madame Secretary,

A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.

U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August 20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to school while we complete this security review.

I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate security.

Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S. location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

There was clearly somebody feding him some of these lines. He repeated the line that events have changed and that the U.S. must see the situation for what it is: Hizbollah, Iran, Al-Qaeda, the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt are all manifestations of a radical Islamic movement sweeping the region. The U.S. must use its influence to stop UK and France from the bombing. Zlitny said the Libyan Government recognizes its mistakes from the start of the crises, but believes that now the crisis (of radical Islam) is real .

I promised you I'd let you know the very moment I had made a decision on the Humphrey School.

And in what has been the most difficult career decision I have ever confronted, I have decided to accept their offer. It was so difficult because I cannot imagine a more meaningful and fulfilling position than the one I now hold. And I cannot imagine a more inspiring leader than the Secretary — or more support than that which I've received from you, and from others on her senior-level team.

I've always believed deeply that how one leaves a job is as important as how one executes his or her responsibilities while on the job, and I'm committed to ensuring that my transition does not impair the Department's humanitarian (or QDDR) work. To that end, and with the Congressional schedule very much in my mind, I have arranged with the University a midOctober start date, which should give me the chance to bring to closure a number of very important Bureau humanitarian initiatives and, more importantly, should give the Department adequate time to ensure a smooth transition. And I will do everything I possibly can to help you on that front.

Because news of this may get out, I'm planning to send the Secretary a personal note today (on which I will copy you), but I wanted to be sure you were the very first person to know.

Kind regards, Eric

Israel is ready to discuss the matter."" He noted that Egypt (didn't specify, but presumably EGIS) had spoken with someone in Hamas' Gaza political leadership this morning, who stated that Hamas ""does not want to blow up the whole situation ... there need to be red lines beyond which no one progresses, so we are able to ultimately contain the situation and return back to the position from which we started."" Othman reiterated that the Egyptians are having great difficulty in reaching contacts from Hamas' military wing, ""as they've all gone underground, and are not picking up their phones."" He also noted that ""there is a sentiment of profound fury within Hamas over al-Ja'bari's killing, it will be very hard to convince them to return to calm this time.""

Othman said that Cairo is nonetheless actively trying to calm the situation, urging Hamas leadership to get things under control, as ""it is not in Egypt's interest for the situation to deteriorate, as the more it does, the harder it will be for our leadership to contain the mood in Egypt."" He underscored that ""Egypt is doing its part to try to restrain Hamas, and the U.S. needs to do its part to restrain Israel.""

You will have to stress among other things:

That summer 2011 is the start of a transition, the pace and nature of which will be driven by conditions on the ground.

That our resolve is reflected in a tripling of troops since Obama took office, and a significant civilian commitment that will continue after our combat forces leave.

That we aren't just going to let the Taliban sit around and wait -- we are surging in Afghanistan to take the fight to them and redoubling our efforts with the Pakistanis to squeeze the other side of the border.

Without getting into too much detail, I would say that both 1) appreciate the President's effort to engage with PM Erdogan and President Morsi on this; 2) recognize the opportunity represented by today's consultations in Cairo; and 3) will try to give it enough time to see if it can succeed in producing a stable ceasefire.

They will obviously be looking for some signs of goodwill from the other side to determine if any proposed ceasefire is real -- they note that they observed a pause during PM Kandil's visit to Gaza, whereas Hamas et al fired dozens of rockets during the visit, so they are wary. They are in direct contact with the Egyptians, of course, and have had some direct contact with the Turks.

Amidror was not enthusiastic about the notion of a ""US guarantee"" of Israeli action.

On the federalism issue, Jalil is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A cabinet change won't solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to take on the Bargans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed the large Obeidi tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing their beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.

The cabinet and TNC need to have a serious discussion with the Barcians - if they aren't already doing so about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held similarly heated debates on this very topic in the earlyl 950s as they held their first parliamentary elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had calmed down).

As you'll all recall, in early July the organizers of World Pride presented an award to Secretary Clinton for her work on LGBT human rights globally. S accepted the award via video and Political MC Toby Bradley gave a personal acceptance speech as well.

On top of the award, an American artist made the attached flag in honor of the Secretary. It's a take on the American Flag and has the words of her speech in Geneva sewn in to the flag. Those countries where same-sex relations are criminalized appear as ""dark hole"" stars, those where criminalization laws have been removed appear as white stars. As countries decriminalize, the dark holes become white stars. There are a lot more details (Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt's silhouettes, for instance) that make this work of art a really impressive piece.

It is currently hanging in the entrance lobby at Embassy London and is having a dramatic impact there. The hope is that S will be able to be photographed with it hanging there at some point. Further discussions are ongoing about how best to use this artwork, and where is might eventually land (museum, Clinton Library, Art in the Embassy program, etc...).

Happy to talk more about this, if folks have ideas or interest.

Thanks, Ken","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","2","3","2"

We are putting together a small team from State and BBG to provide market analysis and help guide a strategic planning process. We agreed to put this on a fast track so that we can come back to you with recommendations within a matter of weeks.

The BBG is already considering some structural changes which should bring BBG into the 21st century and help us achieve the larger goal of raising the voice of the USG. Walter and I both agree that the organization as presently configured is largely dysfunctional. Among the things under consideration is the consolidation of the entities into one operating unit and the appointment of a CEO to oversee all broadcast activities. Also looking at the possibility of creating a global newsroom. Unclear at this point if any of this will require Congressional approval.

Will keep you posted as things move forward.

"C05760604_1","","I'm sure you've already seen this story in the NYT. I just wanted to say that I am very sorry that it has played out as it has.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/world/americas/27mexico.html? r=1&ref=world

It is unfortunate that the press focus has been on failed states. I would have hoped the stories would have focused on the work that I have done the past three years leading the Foreign Policy program at Brookings and directing a major international project on global governance that has called for bringing Mexico, Brazil, China, India and South Africa into new institutional arrangements for global governance. In the study we stress that none of the major transnational challenges of the day — from the economic crisis to climate change — can be solved without engaging the world's emerging economies, starting with Mexico, and giving them an equal seat at the table in an expanded G8.

The other key theme is the work I have done in bringing together ""government-wide"" initiatives to work in partnership with other countries. One cannot treat drugs, immigration, energy and international politics in separate cones. Rather, they affect each other, and our foreign policy needs to integrate these interconnected elements into a coherent strategy that produces results. The point is that we want to work with our international partners in ways that address their realties — and not let policy be derived from our bureaucratic structures.

I understand that the situation with Mexico is complicated. I am ready to help in whatever way I can to produce the most productive outcome.

If confirmed, the decision would open the door for a new antidumping case against Mexico, which the GOM claims will severely impact a $2 billion industry that employs 350,000 people. There have also been veiled threats of retaliation against US agricultural products.

I received a call from the Mexican Embassy about this yesterday. They are incensed. I would not be surprised if this becomes a major news item in Mexico over the weekend, which is why I thought S might want to know.

Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual ""Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger"" Award to Secretary Clinton this year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus rooms). Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business leaders, administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.

As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.

Before officially announcing Secretary Clinton as this year's award recipient, we hoped to confirm that Secretary Clinton will be available to personally accept the award. We plan to schedule the award ceremony in September on either a Tuesday or Wednesday evening (at approximately 6:30/7pm). We would select the specific date based on Secretary Clinton's schedule.

I think the ceremony would provide another good opportunity to shine a spotlight on the unprecedented commitment of Secretary Clinton and President Obama to addressing global hunger. Thank you for your help in engaging the appropriate officials in the State Department.

Next week the GAVI Alliance will ask donors to commit $3.7 billion to immunize an additional 4 million children by 2015. Now, as GAVI prepares for its next decade of progress under new leadership, is an opportune moment to examine critical challenges and how they can be addressed to ensure continued success. This policy brief, GAVI'S Future: Steps to Build Strategic Leadership, Financial Sustainability, and Better Partnerships, was developed collaboratively by the CSIS Global Health Policy Center and the Center for Global Development. The brief provides analysis and recommendations to GAVI leadership in three vital issue areas: GAVI's mandate and business model; its financing strategy; and the GAVI Secretariat and partners' capacities.

Its many achievements notwithstanding, GAVI will need a strengthened, strategic approach to meet future demands. In the midst of a global recession and constrained donor and national budgets, and as the vaccine landscape expands and becomes more complex, GAVI will need to concentrate on its core mission, extend coverage to the underserved in low-income countries, plan strategically for the future, better tie health systems investments to vaccine gains, and test whether GAVI can contribute to assisting lower-middle-income countries accelerate their immunizations. It is essential that GAVI's financing efforts shape markets to reduce vaccine pricing, at the same time that GAVI aggressively leverages traditional donors, wins over emerging economies, and increases partner government commitments. The GAVI Secretariat can and should do more to maximize its partnerships with UNICEF, the World Bank, and WHO, and GAVI will benefit significantly from much stronger branding, communications, and high-level outreach and representation.

The AU is moving forward with plans to hold a signing ceremony at 1000 Addis/0300 EDT Sunday, 06/19 in hopes of calling bluffs. If the signing actually happens, S/USSES will call Ops immediately. However, S/USSES is skeptical about whether the sighing would actually take place. They noted to us that this is the third or fourth time the parties have gotten to this point.

Southern Kordofan: No movement on an agreement on cessation of hostilities in Southern Kordofan to report. The AU is reportedly considering calling for a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire to create space for talks. Mbeki may call for this publicly tomorrow.

Earlier this evening Ambassador Lyman spoke with GoSS Minister Pagan Amum through Ops. A few highlights:

• Lyman emphasized that President Kiir told the Secretary he had approved the agreement. He said he did not want to tell the Secretary President Kiir does not speak for his government.

• Amum assured Lyman they have agreed to leave out all discussion of final status of Abyei and the agreement would be signed Sunday. Amum claimed that there was a clear understanding and the agreement would be signed with the language changed to reflect the wording from the Abyei protocols.

I wanted to send you a short note about today's release of the new Global Burden of Disease study and how it relates to cookstoves. The study estimates that 4 million people die each year from exposure to cookstove smoke — that's twice as many people as we thought (2 million). The study now ranks this as the 4th worst health risk factor in the world (we used to say it was 5th worst in developing countries), after only high blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol use. And it is the 2nd worst health risk factor in the world for women and girls, after only high blood pressure. Exposure to cookstove smoke is the single worst health risk factor in South Asia for both sexes, and the 2nd worst health risk factor in SubSaharan Africa (though first for women in most parts of SSA). This 4 million figure is more than the study attributes to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria combined.

But the most shocking statistic of all is that only a handful of people are working full-time to solve this severe risk factor: 15 staff at the Alliance, Jacob and a few other U.S. federal employees, a few staff in different U.N. agencies, a handful of bilaterally-funded efforts, and scattered researchers, businesses and NG0s.

Whitney Williams has joined us to flesh out a vision for a series of conferences that would bring together policymakers and experts from the field with women you have met around the world - and people at the grassroots level in this country.

Each conference would be followed by a special event featuring musical, cultural and culinary celebrities (yep, celebrity chefs) from the U.S. and other countries to generate visibility online and in the entertainment media, which would reach a lot more people than the policy conference alone.

"C05784594_1","","Jake,

Jeremy said you took note of the Islamist protests and asked for an assessment. Here's my quick take.-Andrew

Islamist forces do not command nation-wide support and probably do not represent a direct political threat to the TNC, but their advanced battlefield experience and access to weaponry could pose a significant military challenge.

• The Islamists are not particularly popular outside of certain areas of eastern Libya. Sallabi and his followers are as vilified as Jibril in much of the country. Indeed, many of the political groups that oppose Jibril, such as those centered in Misrata, view the Islamists with equal, if not, more hostility.

• Both Islamist and secular militias have operated with relative restraint so far. With Sirte and Bani Walid still in regime hands and Qadhafi on the loose, there is enough of a rationale to support continued cooperation.

• However, once operations against Qadhafi and the regime are wrapped up, this force for unity is likely to dissipate. It is at this point that militias, including the Islamists, will probably abandon caution and pursue a more aggressive campaign for power, perhaps including violence.

Even though the Islamists may not be able to displace the INC. Jibril and his allies suffer from a serious credibility problem. If the INC fails to make strides in giving other political movements (in Tripoli, Misrata, Zintan, and elsewhere) a real role in governance, it may find itself without a viable national political base.","3","3","1","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"

Madame Secretary, From my perch just outside your office I have had quite a view of history in the making and it has been a distinct honor and privilege. Your entire State Department family in Washington and at all of our embassies and consulates around the world have been inspired by your unrelenting passion, dedication, sense of duty and mind boggling stamina!

You will be missed here at the Ship of State and you will always be remembered with the greatest of respect, admiration and affection.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you have done for us, for our country and for so many around the world.

"C05797215_1","Likud down, Lapid rises","I'm no expert on Israeli politics, but the exit polls are interesting.

As Dan noted in an email to some, the big news is a poorer than expected (but still leading) showing for Bibi, a surprise surge for Lapid, Bennett not so hot after all, and Kadima has fallen off the map. Tzipi's new party is polling 7 seats.

Emerging bottom line: Bibi could do a 61 seat right/right coalition if he can work with Bennett and Shas. Razor thin but fewer parties to juggle and more ideologically cohesive. Or he could go up to 69 in a limited center-right coalition (with the traditional religious parties but not Bennett, and only Lapid from the center.)

So, while the comparatively poor showing for Bibi's coalition looks to be a sign of weakness, the basic coalition options are still the same as expected but a firmer center partner in Lapid IF that's what he's looking for. Remember he has always said, anyway, he favors the broadest possible government.

And, if the center had formed an electoral coalition —and polled the same results they did separately — they would have outperformed Likud/Beiteinu and at least in theory have had the right to try to form a government. Remember that, when you hear laments that the Israeli public is forever more stuck in the right lane. (But then of course also remember that today's center looks reactionary compared to the center of 20-30 years ago.)

And finally, remember the budget issues — a problem with Shas among others —will loom large in coalition calculations.

Also, we believe that the Chile topper doesn't quite fit. If the idea is to broaden this from Pakistan, a focus on Haiti to open and close would provide a better fit for an example as our involvement in Chile was not as robust.

I was more than a bit annoyed when I heard that at a recent daily meeting, when, in commenting on the success of your web-chat with young Egyptians, you asked why we did not do more of these and someone responded that they were glad to hear they had ""permission"" to do them. As I know you know, I have been pushing people to do this for some time and have made it quite clear that no permission is required.

Since prodding doesn't seem to work I now plan to ""direct"" each regional bureau to work with PA to develop a plan for weekly web-chats focused on issues of regional relevance and engaging the full range of DC based FSO's and subject matter experts, including those with language skills suited to each region. We invest an enormous amount in training our officers and this will help leverage that investment. This isn't brain surgery and can be done quite simply and efficiently if people put their minds to it.

Will the withdrawal be conditions-based or begin automatically?

Summer 2011 is a strategic inflection point.

We are guaranteeing a U.S. troop level for a certain period of time. That is 18 months from now. The situation will change, and so we will naturally reassess where things stand.

Our emphasis is on building capacity so that the Afghans can assume natural ownership of their own security. We plan to begin to remove our combat troops as we transfer responsibility to the Afghans.

The pace of the withdrawal will be based on an assessment of conditions

NOTE: The assumption seems to be that the transfer process will be a district by district effort, and that there will surely be at least one district where we can transfer by summer 2011.

Our Chargé reached out to Nigerian MFA Permanent Secretary Uhomoibhi, the number two at the Foreign Ministry and President Jonathan's point-man for UN Security Council coordination.

Although it was well after midnight in Pretoria, Nhlapo pledged to pass the message to colleagues working the issue. I underscored the urgency.

German ambassador Koch phoned at 5pm, said that Westerwelle had reached Khar. Ten minute call, cordial.

W made the pitch: that the international community has been trying to ensure that Pakistan's interests are represented as we work out the future of Afghanistan. It would be a shame if, at this moment, Pakistan would take itself away from the table.

K said she agreed. She said that during the Defense Committee meeting yesterday, the military had pressed hard for her to announce that she would not go to Bonn, but that she had been able to prevent that [somewhat more forward leaning than when I talked to her]. But she was not sure she could sustain that argument in the days ahead.

Ambassador Koch said that the best we could say was that the door is still open, and we need to keep it open as long as we can. We agreed that with a cabinet meeting Tuesday and a parliamentary session coming this week sometime, keeping the door open will not be easy. But we should continue to press the Pakistanis to come to Bonn.

We also took some time on the Terms of Reference and made good progress there, too. We agreed we will follow up with a small-group experts' meeting on Monday afternoon.

The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation

I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world, but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.

The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.

The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss.

A couple thoughts and some perspective:

1) The latest Gallup poll covers the dates of Oct. 11-Oct. 17 which means it is only capturing one day of post-debate sentiment. We won't have a full post-debate sample until Tuesday (Oct. 16-22). I will leave it to Gary to explain any other details about polling methodology etc.

2) There is an expectation by many that the race will tighten back up next week, thanks in part to an expected boost in Democratic enthusiasm.

3) That said, if Romney retains a lead in this poll — or any other airworthy poll, it suggests that Romney's big win in Denver and his solid performance at Hofstra helped him to finally clear the ""acceptability"" bar with those wavering Obama 2008 voters he needs to win over. The Romney campaign has long held that this race will resemble 1980 where the race remained very close until the very end when it broke dramatically in Reagan's favor. Like Romney, Regan's big break came from a solid debate performance. However, the political polarization in this country is much more intense and solidified than it was in 1980.","2","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

Madam Secretary — As expected, Senator Reid moved today (11/15) to amend the pending Energy and Water appropriations bill to add our bill plus the Financial Services bill to create the second ""minibus"" appropriations package. Senators Menendez, Nelson, Rubio all objected to the motion because of language allowing bank to bank transactions between Cuba and the United States contained in the Financial Services bill.

Senator Reid then offered a modified motion that removed the Cuba language. Senators Moran (KS) and Vitter both objected. Moran because he supports the Cuba bank transfer language and Vitter because of Mexico City policy, UNFPA and what he described as language permitting abortion on demand in Washington DC.

Senator Reid then proceeded to fill the amendment tree on the underlying Energy and Water bill, essentially freezing action on the Senate floor until some sort of agreement is reached on the universe of amendments to be considered. That agreement could encompass amendments to our bill or simply to Energy and Water. So we are in a holding pattern until Senators figures out how they would like to go forward.

Senator Reid has made it clear that he intends to complete the conference report on the first ""minibus"" which contains the CR through December 16th as well as the Defense authorization bill before adjourning for Thanksgiving and has already threatened to keep the Senate in through the weekend and into early next week.

FOR KABUL: While it appears that Insurgents hoped to capitalize on the NATO summit to send a message, and likely chose Laghman because of it has been relatively peaceful and secure, this incident underscores the Governor's talking points that, while Laghman has been peaceful and made great progress on all fronts in the past 9 years, Afghanstan still needs security and development assistance to defeat the terrorists, who only bring destruction, fear, and oppression.

"C05770810_1","","Dear Cheryl:

I wanted to inform you about the current status of the nomination process for my re-election as President of the Bank that began on 10 May and will remain open through 24 June.

As of this date, I have been nominated by 24 countries, 20 of them regional member countries, representing 48.894 % of the voting power.

The list of countries is as follows: Argentina, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El. Salvador, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Uruguay, Trinidad and Tobago, Korea, Japon, Netherlands y Canada.

Consequently, my nomination fulfills the first requirement of nominations by at least of 15 regional member countries;

The second requirement, a majority of the total voting power of all the Bank's shareholders, is almost fulfilled as of today.(51 %)

Further, no other candidates have been nominated as of this date.","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"

I just spoke with Uzra. D (B) would like to come to Istanbul, and his attendance would be really helped if the meeting could begin at 15:00. (He is on leave but would break for the meeting.) He can make it commercially at around 13:00 in Istanbul, and it would be a push to make it to venue by 14:00. (Milair options also being explored.)

*ISRAEL* 1. Israel should offer voluntary compensation to settlers to leave the West Bank. (NB not unilateral, part of orchestrated interaction) 2. Build housing now within Israel to show you don't intend permanent occupation. 3. Only build future settlement housing within the blocs - not beyond them. 4. Open Area C to economic activity for Pals. Just 120k pals live there, but -- alongside Jewish settlements-- all the rock quarries are there, and Pals have no access. 5. Increase Palestinian police presence in Area B, and increase their areas of responsibility. 6. Work out security criteria to limit incursions into Area A.

*PALS* 7. Put Israel on their maps 8. Acknowledge historic Jewish connection to the land and to Jerusalem. 9. Stop incitement / de-legitimization. (No more hiding behind local officials on this). 10. Condition your public for peace. (ie returning to Arafat's ""peace of the brave"" rhetoric). 11. Start building permanent housing in camps for refugees. 12. Make major investments in rule of law/anti-corruption efforts.

He has subsequently shared with me a number of specific materials on the Haiti project, including an email of yours which highlights the objectives of the project and a suggested timeline, as well as the business proposal made by Hansoll. When I digest these latter materials, I will consider myself in a much better position to make responsive recommendations to you.

As I communicated to Jean-Louis, I am happy to be helpful to you and the State Department on this project. I can make myself available a couple of days a month for meetings and pretty much on an as needed basis for phone conversations. I retain my affiliation with Warburg Pincus, the global private equity firm. This requires my presence in New York (generally) a couple of days a week. As I think you know, I am also Chairman of the Board of Campbell Soup Company. This entails three or four days a month.

Fortunately, I am not really ""retired."" This means that I have some flexibility in how I spend my time. You should feel free to call on me.

I retain my interest in and connections with the retail and apparel industry. While I am far from an expert on sourcing and production of apparel and textiles, I have some relevant experience and many friends who will do their best to keep me from looking foolish.

I will be in Baltimore and Washington for the next few days. Either you or Jean-Louis should feel comfortable in calling on my cell phone

In the interim, I will review these materials and speak again with Jean-Louis.

Below are the results of the 2nd round:

African Group (1 seat available) • Mauritania 72 • Togo 119

Eastern European Group (1 seat available) • Azerbaijan 90 • Slovenia 97

Bottom line: results inconclusive. Since none received the required two-thirds vote of members present, voting and submitting valid ballots (which is varying in each vote), the General Assembly is immediately proceeding to a third round of voting. The third round is again restricted to the above countries.

If the third round is inconclusive, the fourth round (and 5th and 6th) will be an ""unrestricted"" round, whereby votes may be cast for any eligible Member from the respective regions, including those that were part of the first round but not part of 2nd or 3rd rounds, i.e. Hungary could get some votes.

Voting for third round has occurred, ballots are being collected, and the General Assembly will soon be in recess again to count the votes.

As they committed during Indian Commerce Minister Sharma's visit earlier this month and projected as far back as Minister Fahim's September 2011 visit to India, Pakistan's cabinet approved a new negative list with India today (before the end of February).

The new negative list of 1209 restricted product lines (of about 6800 tradeable categories) replaces the previous positive list of about 1900 allowable product lines. This more than doubling of tradeable goods roughly meets my expectations but may be a disappointment given the wild hopes of some in New Delhi, especially given that the negative list rejected by cabinet two weeks ago included only 636 products. The late additions reflect last minute pressure from the autoparts, machinery, and textiles industries. Implementation is set to occur within one month, and the goal is still to phase out the list by end 2012 and to announce Most Favored Nation status at that point. (Comment: Though I am skeptical that they will be able to move that fast given the political calendar and industry pressures. Other countries,

including India, maintain a limited sensitive list and are considered technically WTO. compliant.)

This is real and historic progress for Indo-Pakistan relations, a big victory for Zardari's government, and a real achievement for the New Silk Road vision.

Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning around 830 am (Declan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.

The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.

The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring down the assembly or collapse the process.

Declan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.

"C05762607_1","","After some more thinking and conversation today I have another suggestion for the link b/w diplomacy and development on the QDDR. Suppose we say that the point is to elevate both diplomacy and development relative to defense and thus to look at how development can strenthen our diplomacy and how the tools of diplomacy (direct negotiations w/ govts, work thru international and regional organizations, tools of 21st century statecraft) can strengthen development. If we emphasize the tools of diplomacy it is more tied to resources -- eg what we fund and develop and what we don't.

But he was in an expansive mood with me nonetheless. He thought we should consider an option where Q would have to leave ""temporarily,"" while ceasefire and political process and dialogue issues were worked out. But we hold the door open for a possible return of Q if ""the people demand it,"" as Mohammed Ismail keeps telling him is the case.

He also thought it's time for us to expand upon the UNSCR 1973 language and ""call Qadhafi's bluff' by establishing detailed performance benchmarks that would be nominally consistent with Q's offer of a ceasefire and political process. I noted that Q's previous words about a ceasefire have been at odds with his actions on the ground. That's the point, Clark argued -- make him perform or demonstrate clearly his failure to do so.

PM Brown praised all parties involved; stressed the need to adhere to the dates laid out in the agreement several times; welcomed the supportive Westminster interventions during the Q and A of SDLP Mark Durkan and DUP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dods, but pointedly expressed hope that other parties (read UUP, whose MP was either not present or simply didn't speak) would express their support as soon as possible.

As expected, David Cameron praised the agreement and all parties; raised the desire that all parties (read SDLP and UUP) be given time to review the document; and pointedly asked the PM what issues that were not expressly mentioned in the agreement would be addressed by the Working Group -- to which Brown responded, ""all the issues outstanding from St Andrew's.""

Cameron and Brown praised the U.S. role, singling you out. Brown also twice referred to your offer to host an investment conference.

Overall, nothing concerning from the Tories...on the contrary, full support, a request that the minority parties have a chance to review and some questions on outstanding issues.

UUP MLAs meet tonight to review.

Note: DUP interventions were balanced.. .Dods raised parades and decommissioning as reminder of outstanding issues, but stressed desire of all parties ""not to go back"" to the bad old days.

I am a colleague of Professor Erlinder and also a graduate of Yale Law School ('79). I invoke the latter connection in hopes of obtaining your attention to a plea on Professor Erlinder's behalf.

Professor Erlinder and I agree on very little politically. Indeed, we disagree on almost every issue. However, I want the U.S. government to do everything it can to speedily obtain Professor Erlinder's release.

But those merits are, in my opinion, entirely beside the point, as is the question of whether Professor Erlinder was foolish or brave to return to Rwanda. I respect both Don Quixote and Clarence Darrow. The point is that Professor Erlinder put himself at risk to ""walk the walk"" of a fundamental principle of any free society — the right to counsel. The defendants at the Nuremberg trials had counsel. The Israelis accorded Eichmann counsel.

It now appears that Professor Erlinder's detention may turn into a covert execution. ""Under intense interrogation from detectives, detained American Prof. Peter Erlinder swallowed up to 50 tablets meant to treat hypertension and other medical conditions — which the Police now says is also another crime, RNA can exclusively reveal.""

Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi victory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.

One missing piece here is leadership. Who can attract/retain/manage/hold accountable a team at the highest level. I just don't see who would be on par with Sec. Clinton in terms of that aspect.

The other missing piece is coordinating Treasury and multilateral engagement. WB and EU are probably bigger ag funders than US govt even after we start spending real money in these countries.

This is particularly true on the research, education and extension areas — and that is an area where USDA has CDC like capacity that should be leveraged aggressively. It's true that until recently USDA didn't offer this real capacity it has to anyone -- forcing people to work through the foreign ag service which is a completely different way to engage. But that is changing rapidly.

It's also true on agricultural infrastructure and marketing, where MCC brings more to the table than anyone — especially in the area of ag infrastructure.

USAID's strength should be in the country planning and country level implementation — and in this respect this initiative (even housed outside of AID)

I also suspect that in early countries we will need to identify strong leadership — which could be existing AID staff but it may be helpful to being open to finding new people at that level if needed.

This is very similar to the initial PEPFAR debate.","1","2","3","2","1","2","2","2","3","2"

I went for news and indeed Guy is right. The meeting occurred yesterday and the decision was made to revoke the government on October 29. I wonder what happened with the initial decision which was strictly concerning Minister Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be touched as the President did not care to have a vacuum in these electoral times. Plus, Michele was finally regarded as ambitionless (not seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to sacrificing some of her Ministers...and again, she being the one to name their replacements, has brought about the decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom the instructions have originated. It is a head to head match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is obviously not good. Nobody will stand against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.

I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on the other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the individual power to stand against the vote for which consensus is being secured.

• The UN and other international players (at least locally) after having cried victory, success and democracy are reluctant to openly and publically denounce the matter.

In the past 48 hours, the political situation in Pakistan has entered a new phase. The Supreme Court ruled the NRO illegal and paved the way for prosecution of several government officials, most notably Interior Minister Rehman Malik.

In addition, the Supreme Court has opened the door to new petitions to be filed, questioning Zardari's eligibility to have run for president in the first place.

Nothing like this has ever been attempted in our community. We have been involved in precedent shattering conversations with Mexican civil society leaders, including the most prominent business leaders. We have reached deep into our pockets to demonstrate financial commitment. I personally gave $10k to this effort. I am not alone.

"C05782016_1","","To the editor:

As a human rights advocate who over the years has both agreed and argued with State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh, I felt that Paul Starobin's suggestion that Koh has betrayed his principles (""A Moral Flip-Flop, August 7) left an unfair impression. Koh's problem is that when he associates himself with an administration policy that troubles his friends, we know about it, since of course he is free to agree publicly with his president (and since the administration is likely to roll him out as a spokesman on precisely those occasions). When he pushes to change or strengthen a policy in ways that champions of human rights would cheer, we are less likely to find out, because he has to be discreet in such efforts to remain effective. But whatever one thinks of his arguments about the War Powers Act and Libya, Koh has remained a dogged champion of many causes to which he has dedicated his life — from urging the administration to stick to its guns on closing Guantanamo, to advocating civilian trials for terror suspects, to elevating the promotion of human rights and justice for war crimes in American foreign policy.

"C05791561_1","","Deputy Secretary Burns, Jake, Alec,

Please keep close hold, but my team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from. Our logic behind this is that while many people are tracking the atrocities, nobody is visually representing and mapping the defections, which we believe are important in encouraging more to defect and giving confidence to the opposition. Given how hard it is to get information into Syria right now, we are partnering with Al-Jazeera who will take primary ownership over the tool we have built, track the data, verify it, and broadcast it back into Syria. I've attached a few visuals that show what the tool will look like. Please keep this very close hold and let me know if there is anything else you think we need to account for or think about before we launch. We believe this can have an important impact.

Who can give me a brief summary of the particular marking strategies of each of the grantees?

Now that I'm a seasoned veteran (in Islamabad for a month) I'd like to see an American flag on every item/project. Nothing else. Just the flag. Every Pakistani with whom I've spoken has told me that fancier logos, including the USAID logo, dilute the clarity of the marking, contributing to the overwhelming message I've received all over the country: ""America announces repeatedly its billions in assistance. We see none of it. Therefore it's going directly into the coffers of corrupt Pakistanis."" Or worse: a cabinet minister told me two days ago that ""KLB money is being taken from the Pakistani people to build a new embassy compound in Islamabad.""

• Over 20% of California's debt issuance during 2009 and over 30% of its debt issuance in 2010 to date has been subsidized by the federal government in a program known as Build America Bonds. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury covers 35% of the interest paid by the bonds. Arguably, without this program the interest cost of bonds for some states would have reached prohibitive levels.

• ""California is not alone: Over 30% of Illinois's debt and over 40% of Nevada's debt issued since 2009 has also been subsidized with these bonds. These states might have already reached some type of tipping point had the federal program not been in place.""

• ""Today, more than 28% of state funding comes from federal government transfers, the highest contribution on record. These transfers have made states dependent on federal assistance. New York, for example, spent in excess of 250% of its tax receipts over the last decade. The largest 15 states by GDP spent on average over 220% of their tax receipts. Clearly, states have been spending at unsustainable levels without facing immediate consequences due to federal transfer payments and other temporary factors.""

The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them skills needed to live on their own as adults.

Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I think it is widely accepted that Hillary championed this legislation, and this was surely echoed by Don. He was beaming with admiration for her and what she accomplished to help the kids.

He went on to say that one of the participants in the program, Alfred Perez, who was part of the original discussion with the First Lady, was invited to the White House to see the bill signed.

If the Senate doesn't change, Congress may be able to salvage the 50m or something close to it, exclusively for State in the post-CR '13 appropriations.

Separately, there is 20m proposed for DOS (and 20m for AID) for a fund to implement the gender guidance under QDDR. It's ironic that tomorrow we are rolling out the DOS and AID plans for implementing our national action plan.","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","1","3","2"

If there is an appropriate way to do so, I wondered if you might convey to Secretary Clinton how much it meant to me personally and to so many of us that she led us last night for cathartic story-telling and laughter. It was such a terrible evening, but she managed to ignite warmth at a moment when everything felt frozen still. Her ability to lift us all up after a trip to Canada, hosting a huge reception, and on top of her own loss, was itself a rallying cry to soldier on the way Holbrooke would have insisted we do. She helped fill the tremendous sense of void with funny memories and an appreciation of how deeply he touched so many of us. I felt better by the time I left, and still do.

Many thanks,

This is probably already on your radar, but wanted to make sure I flagged.

Beth Jones was designated as Acting A/S for NEA on June 1 (the day after Jeff vacated the position). As I understand it, under the Vacancies Reform Act, she can only retain the Acting title for 210 days unless a nominee is pending before Congress.

Her 210 days will run up on December 28th but can be extended if someone is nominated when Congress gets back early January.

I know this is odd timing given the transition. PPO has not said anything to me about this yet either.

I can speak with L about whether there is any leeway in extending the 210 days particularly given transition. Also I will confirm that under the Vacancy Reform Act, if Beth's clock does run out, then Liz Dibble in her capacity as PDAS can automatically serve as Acting if we want to go that route.

Spoke to the person you recommended on Friday. Sounds like he is comfortable and even surprised that Pakistanis are doing more. And maybe he will find some more ways to help, like the helicopter leasing. When I mentioned that someone deep in the ISI must be happy that Al Qaeda's alive, so we don't abandon Pakistan again, he chuckled.

I talked about the ""vetting"" for intelligence. I also talked ""defeat strategy,"" and the need for something more than just deploying more forces and hoping the training for the Afghans will work.

I continue to be struck by the parallels to Vietnam, and especially Johnson's inability to resist escalation, and his advisor's continued ""incrementalism.""

But I'm encouraged by the pace of the review. Seems that there's sufficient time to consider this from all angles.

I can imagine there are those arguing that we just need to fill the gap while we enlarge the Afghan army. That we help the Pakistanis but not press them to the point of being unpleasant. And that too much focus on Osama and al-Zawahiri raises the risk of public failure if we don't get them. There is much logic to this, but it has a strong tint of incrementalism.

Hopefully, we can be more decisive: lean harder on the Pakistanis, provide more troops to McChrystal than his ""moderate risk"" and raise the heat on al Qaeda - then do all we can to push economic development in Afghanistan, restrain Indian meddling, and prepare to do more against Al Qaeda in Pakistan, directly if necessary. Ultimately, it seems that our best exit strategy would be to take down the top leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, and then gradually draw down in Afghanistan.

Wish I could do more to help

Thanks for flagging this. We actually saw this last night, and Vikram and I had a conversation with Richard about it. The report was based on interviews conducted in May-June, before the new policy change was implemented, so much of the report is already OBE. OIG gave us the draft report in October, and SRAP/SCA/INL immediately sent a joint response to OIG (attached), highlighting that we were already working on many of the issues highlighted in the report.

Given the change in policy and our letter to them, we found it pretty egregious that the OIG didn't report on the changes underway or adjustments already made, as the report is being portrayed in the press as currently applicable. Michael Keays on the Afghan desk and Peggy, who both help to oversee CN issues, are already working on a letter to OIG expressing our strong concern about the report and the process which got us to this point, and Vikram and his team are ginning up press points which also note that we have already begun to robustly address many of these points (I've cc'ed them all on this).

He then told me that they had made an effort to broaden the coverage. He also referred to pieces in the NY Times and International herald tribune which also focused on comments from Brazilians and MSF. I pointed out that perhaps the bigger story was that with so many international organizations involved it was astonishing that so few had complaints.

Madam Secretary,

Patricia Espinosa will likely see you in Montevideo and mention your trip to Mexico on March 23. One of her concerns is to make sure that other cabinet members who belong to the High-Level Group on security issues also participate. On our side the other two key players are Secretaries Napolitano and Gates. Espinosa will try to make sure their counterparts are there. It would be helpful if you could call Napolitano and Gates and encourage them to come. Napolitano's role on Juarez and the border is especially critical.

I am on the way back to Mexico City from El Paso following the de-brief from an intensive week-long planning session that involved all key US and Mexican security agencies. We have a strong plan. Calderon now needs to make important decisions on command and control, force deployments, and prosecutorial capacity. We are still working on the socioeconomic plan. They can turn the violence around, but they will need to be resolute and clear about responsibilities and authorities. It would be helpful if you could tell Espinosa that you are aware of the plan and affirm the importance of establishing a unified command structure for the security operations in Juarez.

1. ""Across the Atlantic, Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American development agenda. That is the right choice. As David Cameron and Jeff Sachs argued earlier this year, women can hold the key to development in the world's poorest countries — in education, enterprise, micro-finance and healthcare. Investing in women pays dividends throughout the entire community.""

2. ""I see DFID as a key, joined-up, integrated department, a bright star in the Whitehall constellation, a department of state for development in the developing world. That's why DFID has a seat at the Cabinet table and it's why I won't be satisfied until our message rings down the corridors of each and every department in Whitehall.""

We obviously don't love the ""dept of state for development language,"" but what is most noteworthy is his emphasis on ""joined-up"" and ""integrated"" dept — underlining the fact that DFID as a separate cabinet department has been almost divorced from the rest of the government.

I spoke to HAK yesterday and have some instructions. He also asked me, once again, to say how very much he appreciates the effort Hillary and you gave made. Please pass that on to the Secretary. He very much wants to get this settled during her time as Secretary.

We need to do a bit more homework and hope to get back to you very soon after Labor Day.

"C05763508_1","Heads up on comm farming etc.","I would be careful with the commercial farming. Many African leaders support it because it's good for their cronies. Paul Collier has been one of the most vocal supporters of commercial farming - mostly because of the success of Brazil. Our USAID colleagues are much less supportive because historically it doesn't have as much benefit for the poor as working directly with rural farmers. I think the best way to frame this issue is to say: we support small holder farmers and that's what our programs will emphasize; but, if we see an opportunity for commercial farms to also help achieve our goal of lifting 100 million out of hunger and poverty, then we will support it. In general, commercial farms usually benefit those who are above the poverty line - not those below it. Best, Matt","3","2","3","3","2","1","2","2","2","1"

Norway is going to be funding and staffing a new NATO Special Rep on Women, Peace and Security and the position will be in the NATO Secretariat, which is quite significant. Moreover, Sweden is making available to NATO the Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations. These are both tangible new steps in promoting WPS in military operations. You have no idea what you unleashed when the US launched the National Action Plan!

Also FM Store is interested in raising the following issues with you in Chicag: Burma, Libya and Afghanistan; broader trends on women and mediation/engagement in international dialogues and peace processes, the important link between global health and efforts to address conflict-related sexual violence and ensuring that sexual violence and women's participation remains part of international dialogue with Syria.

Finally, we are looking for ways to focus the US Burma human rights groups (from simply raising the issues of on-going violence in the areas, some of it targeted on women) to actually supporting women in the ethnic conflict areas by focusing on concrete ways to enable the ethnic women to play a useful role in efforts to end the conflicts and participate in future peace agreements.","3","2","1","2","2","3","1","3","1","2"

The new number was determined based on how many of the initially quarantined PVs were deemed valid by the legal unit after review. (Note: Observers have not been informed of the thresholds used.) - Each department will have a threshold number that can be adjusted over time as more data becomes available on voter turn-out. This is in contrast to the first round when the threshold number was fixed and used for all departments.

I want to congratulate you and your colleagues on what I regard as a brilliant (and I do not use that term loosely) move that Secretary Clinton will go to Myanmar. I was concerned that the U.S. response to the changes in Myanmar, and what I regard as almost a plea from the Burmese for support to the reforms, might not get more than simply a verbal response. But this indicates the seriousness of the U.S. intent, and I hope will prompt the further positive actions from the Burmese that we all want. This State Department action avoids any congressional issues and yet is a strong signal and so is tactically and strategically important.

Thank all of you for your efforts, because I believe they further U.S. national interests and could assist the Burmese people as well.

It has been a while since I've contacted you directly. Happy New Year to you and your family. I've been pleased to communicate directly with Ambassador Thomas Adams. His approach and willingness to work with unusual suspects in the Haitian diaspora is refreshing.

Please extend my deep appreciation to Secretary Clinton for filling the vacuum in leadership that exists in resolving the haiti election debacle. Her leadership is moving Haiti from the self imposed paralysis imposed by the first round of elections.

Her clear public message endorsing the findings of the OAS Report gave Haitians/ Haitian Americans here and abroad confidence that a rational resolution was at hand.

The Secretary's personal visit to Haiti, this week in the midst of the crises now unfolding across the globe told many of us that Haiti remains important to her and this Administration.

The Secretary's leadership and personal attention to Haiti sent a message a dozen policy statements could not have conveyed. Building a new Haiti requires all our intellect and labor.

Along the way we will have many points of disagreement. However, decisive, positive leadership and direction in Haiti is welcome. Thank you and your team for making it happen.

The OIG recommendations are fairly reasonable, but it would be a stretch to say that these advisers could have somehow stopped the KB fraud (the report does not say this, but the press likely will).

Bombings in Moscow

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this morning's bombings in Moscow, their families, and all the people of Russia. This brutal assault on innocent civilians is another reminder that terrorism is a threat to peace-loving people everywhere and must be met with unwavering resolve. I will offer my personal condolences to Foreign Minister Lavrov later today in Ottawa. Together with our G8 partners, we will discuss how to improve international counterterrorism coordination and cooperation.

We offered Sujay up right away, but DeMint's staff insisted that the Senator was only available to meet on December 16 (the Senate target adjournment date is December 17). This effectively scuttles any chance Sujay has of getting confirmed this Congress.

Unfortunately, we don't have much recourse. Sujay's nomination will remain on Tuesday's business meeting agenda, but given his request, DeMint will exercise his prerogative and ask that she be held over. With no other business meetings scheduled this year, she'll remain stuck in Committee.

There's another factor at play here too. We learned yesterday afternoon that Sujay has taken it upon herself to reach out to different Senator's offices. I don't know what exactly she's been saying, but the leg officer (a State Department fellow) handling Sujay's nomination got an email from Hatch's office. He has been supportive of her and we have a good working relationship with them. I don't know what Sujay said, but the message back from Hatch's person is that ""while we do support her, this really makes us question her common sense and judgment."" We obviously told her to stop her outreach campaign.

"C05790994_4","","MB MP Khaled Deeb informed me today that MB will push to review Camp David and put it to a referendum. The argument is that this would still be ""respecting"" Camp David, because it is Israel that supposedly violates Camp David, and the MB/Egypt will no longer tolerate it. (People who say this never cite specific examples of Israel breaking the treaty, naturally.) Making matters worse, the MB MP said he believed the reports of attacks on Israel from Sinai were invented. So walk through the chain of foreseeable events: Israel will be attacked from Sinai (this is an inevitability); it may respond; MB will claim that Israel fired first, and therefore broke the treaty, ""like it always does,"" etc. And then the treaty, the MB will argue, is broken.

And making matter even worse: the Egyptian MFA official that I hung out with last night made the exact same argument, and similarly believed that the reports of attacks on Israel from Sinai were invented. (This particular official will be Egypt's next mission chief in Tehran, and is an ambassador.)

FYI ---- There is an increasing amount of environmental concern regarding shale gas. EPA has been concerned and I have now heard of a documentary that is quite critical. The science is not all worked out but the principal concern is in relation to the actual chemicals used to extract the gas and the potential hazard they pose to the water supply. I have mentioned this to David Goldwyn and EPA is invited to his meeting in August.

Shale gas exploitation is already taking place in the United States, but there is very little domestic oversight of the practice, and until recently, there were no data whatsoever on the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluids. Congress raised concerns over this in 2009 and appropriated funds for EPA to conduct a scientific study on possible chemical contamination of groundwater that might result from this process. The study is anticipated to be finalized in 2012. The Department of Interior has done a programmatic Environmental Impact Assessment on how exploration can impact public lands, and is allowing fracturing in some locations while deferring activity in others.

Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as I understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are two ways:

1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about our effectiveness.

2. The alternative would be for the administration to say: a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.

b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of housing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we have expressed to them..

c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help promote a two-state solution.

This latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move forward. Of course, I am around if you want to discuss. Good luck in India. They are very excited about your visit. Sandy","1","3","1","1","2","2","3","2","3","3"

--Civ -mil relations remain very sensitive. Her bosses do not want US civilians meeting with senior military officials unless the MFA (Salman) is present. (This should be okay with us as wea re the ones who are trying to keep all elements of gov't together on both sides...)

--the Pak-Mil report on 26 November is due to corn out on Friday. It will be ""different"" from ours. The lack of a US apology for the 24 dead still rankles very deeply. An apology could help soften the tendencies of the Parliament t be strident in the recommendations to the government on bilateral relations.

--CT cooperation ""redlines"" are in danger of colliding. It is worth trying to find operational fixes, but the whole ""redlines"" narrative is not helfpul.

--the Pakistan side is looking for progress/gestures in other areas to help deflect hardline positions on the sensitive areas like CT cooperation. Something positive on the Enterprise Fund (like moving forward with a model that does not require legislation), or energy projects, would be useful. But it is important to avoid more empty promises like ROZs.

During the course of the Fifteenth Anniversary joint Review of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau, I had to convey disappointment at times with positions taken by some Department of State personnel. I am writing today, however, to compliment the letter that Acting Assistant Secretary Rodriguez sent Chairman Bingaman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources April 5th regarding the Senate bill to implement the Agreement produced by the Review and also to compliment the efforts that Deputy Assistant Secretary Reed has made regarding the Agreement.

The letter and efforts have displayed deep understanding of the relationship between our freely associated states and the mutual benefits flowing from this special association as well as what is needed to approve the Agreement and continue the association.

Let me also take this opportunity to express great appreciation for the instrumental actions that you and members of your staff took to resolve Review issues, for work done by then Deputy Secretary Lew, and for the involvement of Assistant Secretary Campbell. This attention was absolutely critical to obtaining agreement. I took very seriously the advice given through Jeff Farrow last summer that the Review should be concluded so that an agreement could be approved last year and am grateful for the opportunity that we then had to finally negotiate the issues as well as for Secretary Reed being the negotiator.

Although the Agreement ultimately was sent to the U.S. Congress this year, I am confident that continued perceptive efforts, such as those by Secretaries Reed and Rodriguez, will result in a continuation of the free association between our nations.

"C05784533_1","","SIGIR gets some things wrong in its report on the Police Development Program in Iraq. For example, the $6.2 million per trainer figure is inflated by the initial start-up costs. There are a lot of other ""inaccuracies"" and didn't incorporate many of INL's suggestions. But SIGIR was correct on a number of points. INL made things worse by refusing to meet with SIGIR initially -- at M's recommendation, based on questions about whether SIGIR had authority to investigate this sector. Turns out they did, so they weren't well-disposed toward INL. They viewed INL's cooperation in providing documents and information as insufficient. There are always two sides to that story.

I would say though that the PDP is an Achilles heel for us. There are many uncertainties surrounding it. There was no baseline assessment done (either by DOD or by State) prior to the program. There is no implementing agreement with the Iraqis. MOT's cooperation is not 100% (the ministry does not work with contractors on an assessment, preferring official employees). There is no comprehensive plan. (What we shared with SIGIR is a plan — called Core Work Requirements -- but not a comprehensive one. There had been an attempt to create a better plan, but it kept getting outdated by the situation on the ground.) To some extent, INL is building this airplane while flying it.

In this regard, please be aware that the Chairwoman previously raised this issue during an October 6, 2011 meeting with Deputy Secretary Nides, though no follow-up was taken according to the Chairwoman's staff. In addition, Congressman Chabot's staff has indicated that he may raise this issue during his question period.

Thanks for this — I spent yesterday having folks in the region, our ambassador in Egypt, and our folks in Consular affairs at main state review and consult with each other. There appears to be misinformation circulating. While the GOE is sympathetic to all parties, the GOE has not indicated any willingness to interfere in the proceedings of the Egyptian courts that currently are considering Mr. Bower's challenge to the Egyptian custody decree. Including with regard to any of the matters flagged below.

We do not know when that judicial process will be completed, although the next hearing is scheduled for October. The Embassy is currently trying to ensure that Mr. Bower, who is en route to Egypt now, will be able to see his sons as called for in a current Egyptian court order.

I appreciate your sharing this for context — it is helpful.

I am looking forward to attending the Chiefs of Mission Conference and I'm writing to request a short meeting with the Secretary.

Spain has recently elected a new government, and there are some pending issues that concern me, and I believe the Secretary, which I'd like to discuss with her. These include:

• A White House meeting between President Obama and President Rajoy • Palomares cleanup

• USTR 301 watch list • GOS interest in economic statecraft I know the Secretary has met the new Foreign Minister, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, and I'd like the opportunity to share my own impressions of the new government. I've been invited to a working lunch later this week with Spain's Vice-President and Ministers of Defense, Interior and Foreign Affairs, to discuss the whole range of bilateral issues between us. My meeting with the Secretary, following that meeting, will be especially timely. I would also like to brief the Secretary on a major conference the Embassy will host in Madrid at the end of March on volunteerism and service. Assistant Secretary Stock and Special Representative Balderston have both agreed to attend along with a number of service leaders from the U.S. Because of the Secretary's passion for this subject and the emphasis she has give to it, I thought she'd be interested in learning of our plans. I know the Secretary's time is precious, and I can address all of these matters in a short meeting. Obviously, I'm available any time throughout the week of the conference if this meeting can be scheduled. Finally, I had a very productive audience with the King recently, and he asked me specifically to extend his warm regards to the Secretary. Please let her know. Many thanks, Cheryl. Alan

"C05790662_30","","A group of 56 parties and movements from various revolutionary coalitions have issued a statement on Sunday regarding the continuation of the revolution and the transfer of power from the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) to a civilianelected government, parliament and president. (pls refer to Ahmed's earlier message for full details on this). Among the 56 parties who signed the statement include Al-Wasat Party, The Egyptian Current Party, the Maspero Youth Union, the Democratic Front Party and Al-Hadara Party. The 56 parties and movements put forward ten suggested actions necessary to achieving their joint revolutionary goals.

Please note the following two goals which were included among the ten goals mentioned in their statement: • Holding presidential elections by April 2012 and announcing the presidential elections' schedule before 25 January, 2012. As soon as the president is elected, all the executive powers of the SCAF must be transferred to the president. • Organizing a meeting, independent from the ruling military council, where all political and social movements are represented in order to discuss the specifications of the provisional assembly that will draft the constitution.","3","3","2","3","1","3","1","2","2","1"
"C05786218_0","Rankings","Per your request, Nora asked me to look over the Partnership for Public Service's ""Best Places to Work"" rankings and come up with a strategy for what would drive up our rankings compared with other federal agencies.

DOS ranks #7, which is the highest ranking for a Cabinet-level agency. We rank #3 for Strategic Management and in the top 7 for Effective Leadership (#4), Support for Diversity (#5), Teamwork (#4), Training and Development (#6), and Pay (#7).

Our downfall is Family Friendly Culture/Benefits and Work/Life Balance, where we rate #27 and #19 respectively.

The family friendly culture and benefits category measures the extent to which employees believe family-friendly flexibilities are offered to them, including telecommuting and alternative work scheduling, along with personal support benefits like child care subsidies and wellness programs. The work/life balance category measures the extent to which employees consider their workloads reasonable and feasible, and managers support a balance between work and life.

I will get Pat's thoughts on both of these and set up a time to meet with someone at the Partnership for Public Service to get a sense of what feedback they received from DOS employees in the survey and programs that may be in place in other agencies who fared better in these categories. These two categories could also tie in with the work Jen/Rachel will be doing to increase recruitment, promotion and training women, so I will speak with them about this as well.

These would include returning to the original committee (which is supposed to start work tomorrow) if there was broad agreement to include the Al Azhar ""bill of rights"" in the constitution.

This speech makes me very happy, not just because of the substance, but because this is precisely how I've always thought an effective foreign policy speech should be written: Laying out, explicitly, the hardest questions people actually ask about a particular policy, and then trying to answer them directly, one by one. In other words, naming the elephants in the room, instead of trying to ignore them, as State Department officials are trained to do! I've always wanted to see Hillary give a speech just like this. It would be a great template for addressing other issues as well!

Anyway, precisely because it does take on real questions in a direct way, it leaves us plenty to talk about. But that's the point of a serious speech. So congratulations all around.

This is a ""done deal.""

All that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the award. They want to give her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to address the corps of cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a beautiful medieval revival building. An alternative setting would be the two story atrium in the Marshall Center for Leadership and Ethics. The award would be presented at the end of the address. Media coverage would be welcomed and assisted. She would be honored by being the reviewing person at a regimental review of the corps. A suitable dinner and or luncheon would be arranged.

If this is going to happen it would be a good idea to set the wheels in motion as soon as possible so that the staffs can work out the details.

I said that I recognized that Gail has a history of believing in an independent AID, to which he responded that is not the basis of this exercise, but he did not challenge the characterization of past views.

"C05783951_2","Re-engage with Asia, but carefully","It is not surprising that the US wants to reconnect with Asia. After all, as Barack Obama said at the AsiaPacific Economic Co-operation forum in Hawaii, that is where the action is. Growth in the region averages above 7 per cent. With Europe in crisis and anaemic growth at home, the US wants to tap into Asian markets to meet Mr Obama's target of doubling exports and creating jobs.

After being distracted for a decade in the Middle East, Washington's ""pivot"" towards Asia — to use secretary of state Hillary Clinton's word — shows it has woken up to the region's rise. US re-engagement, in strategic as well as economic terms, is to be broadly welcomed. But there are challenges, even dangers. Washington will need finesse to get it right.

Its main trade initiative is the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr Obama wants the nine negotiating countries plus Japan, if possible — to sign a ""next-generation"" trade agreement by the end of 2012. The TPP is supposed to incorporate non-tariff issues, such as government procurement and intellectual property protection. Getting Japan to sign up to a meaningful deal will be extremely difficult, given intense opposition from farmers. Yet without Japan, the TPP would be a hodgepodge, bringing together countries as diverse as Brunei, Peru, Vietnam and Australia.","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","1","2"

"C05739649_2","","Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.

Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid friendly fire incidents, of course.

"C05782734_1","SUBJECT: Update on Korea, Colombia, and Panama Free Trade Agreements","The House and Senate have tentatively scheduled October 12 votes on the Korea, Colombia, and Panama free trade agreements (FTAs), the day before Korean President Lee Myung-bak's state visit. The House plans to vote to renew Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programs on October 12 as well. The Senate already passed the TAA/GSP bill.

The House Rules Committee announced the House will have one hour of debate on the TAA/GSP bill and 90 minutes of debate for each FTA bill on October 12. The House floor debate will be followed by separate votes on each of the three FTAs as well as the TAA/GSP bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to limit debate on the three FTAs to a total of 10 hours. Barring any objections from Senators, this would allow Senate votes on each of the FTAs October 12. To accommodate the Senate vote, the Senate Finance Committee will hold a markup of the three FTAs on October 11. The normal layover requirement between committee and Senate floor action will likely be waived by unanimous consent to allow the October 12 Senate vote.

FTA supporters expect, and opponents concede, there are sufficient votes in both the House and the Senate to pass all three of the FTAs. Hill staffers expect the Colombia FTA to pass by a relatively narrow margin due to labor opposition. The Korea FTA is expected to pass by a comfortable margin, despite concerns about trans-shipment of goods from China and North Korea. The Panama FTA is expected to pass with little opposition.","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

Just to let u know that David has made a tremendous impression on the people of Camp Ashraf. Although the situation remains dangerous and there's fear of another Iraqi raid, there's also real progress.

Carolyn Ennis of UNHCR has started to register residents as ""People of Concern"" and each of the residents is completing an individual application. Residents have started to be relocated, in modest numbers, to Italy, AUstralia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. There's a significant chance that Canada may accept additional people, including their own passport holders, in the near future. The hope is that this will create a pipeline to allow a larger exodus if the US FTO is lifted.

Both the EU and the UNHCR have used this progress to argue that closing Ashraf by January 1 is ""unrealistic"" and the relocation/registration progress are addressing Malaki's concerns. The immediate problem is to get the UNHCR the logistical help that they need and get some personnel in the Camp to make another attack difficult.","2","1","3","2","2","3","2","2","2","2"

In response to your query about the possibility of going to Goma, I reached out to our colleagues in Embassy Kinshasa to see what has been done in the past. The only reasonably safe way to get to Goma is flying on a MONUC aircraft originating from Kinshasa. That would mean a two hour flight each way, leaving a very small window (probably no more than one hour) to work in events. Moreover, advancing Goma would pose a significant challenge for us for security reasons.

I also asked the Embassy to look into other ways of traveling to Goma — perhaps over land via Kigali (Lew and I had discussed this possibility earlier) — and the Embassy did not like the optics of approaching by land from another country.

CJCS completed his visit to Saudi Arabia with mildly downgraded visits with defense officials today:

- LTG Qubail, Deputy Chief of Staff, MODA - Sheik Mohsen, A/CDR of Saudi National Guard - Prince Khalid, Assistant Minister of Defense and Aviation

The meetings were all collegial. CJCS conveyed he was here to listen as 'he does not live here'. Counterparts conveyed they sought his advice. This mutual quest for counsel allowed for good, warm and open exchange about regional shifts, and Iran.

There was also good attention to Sudan. All interlocutors talked about Abdullah's reforms to date, particularly in education (e.g. the message was: not only are they for reform, they've been doing it for some time)

GCS throughout emphasized was that developments in the region ultimately undermine and discredit Iran's regime and AQ's message in the long run. And we are committed to KSA and its security.

Prince Khalid expressed very directly concern over the state of U.S. military support programs, complaining of changing expectations, insufficient performance, and incomplete equipment. He was pretty insistent. CJCS somewhat surprised, and not happy. Expect some RFIs and follow-up, I would think.

(Should I ask AF to send it directly to the S specials at the same time they send it to the Line so you get it quicker?).

AF demarched all key countries in West Africa and Europe last week (including France) seeking their support for specific actions to achieve four goals: 1) the return of a democratically-elected government in Bamako, 2) a mediated political solution to the instability in the north, 3) strengthened regional efforts to combat terrorist groups in northern Mali, and 4) improved humanitarian access to displaced populations. The actions include the return of interim President Traore to Bamako, with appropriate security assurances by the interim government, and the interim government to set an election date early enough that a new government can take office prior to the May 2013 deadline set by ECOWAS.

Johnnie held a SVTC today with US ambassadors in Abidjan, Bamako, Nouakchott, Niamey and Ouagadougou to discuss host government concerns prior to the upcoming African Union Summit.

A quick summary of what happened tonight in Dublin:

Cowen won the party vote of confidence tonight; the tally won't be made public (yet). Finance Minister Brian Lenihan publically supported the Taoiseach and looks to have improved his position in the party and for taking over FF having chosen the winning side today. Martin gave a strong speech in opposition before the vote and was congratulatory to Cowen publically afterward. He tendered his resignation (while stating he doesn't want anyone else to follow his lead), which Cowen ""reluctantly"" accepted. Both Cowen and Martin's remarks were complimentary toward each other and reaffirmed their friendship. Word is that the Taoiseach will take on the FM's portfolio.

I don't know who will travel to Munich in Martin's place--if it is the Taoiseach and Martin was on the calendar, we'd support a meeting with Cowen in lieu of Martin.

I greatly appreciate your support of our efforts to improve USG outreach to the European Parliament (EP) and wanted to provide you with a brief update on our progress. We have worked very hard at USEU to deepen and intensify our relationship with the EP over the past several months. Specifically, we have,

(1) Increased the flow of high-level USG visitors to the EP. Recent visitors include Janet Napolitano, Dick Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dick Morningstar and Ron Kirk. These visits culminated last month in a highly successful address by VP Biden to a Plenary Session of the EP. I hope that you will also address a Plenary Session of the EP in the near term. (Your town hall meeting at the EP with young leaders last year was well-received here.)

(2) Increased the flow and quality of EP interactions in Washington. We have facilitated a dramatic increase in the number of EP delegations visiting Washington and a significant improvement in the level of their access to high-level USG officials.

(3) Increased USEU outreach to the EP at every level. At the Mission, we are restructuring the way in which we interact with EP leaders by institutionalizing responsibility for key relationships and enhancing accountability. In the coming months, we expect to receive two additional FTEs at the Mission to improve our ability to cover the EP. We have also encouraged our Embassies in member State capitals to meet with European Parliament members.

WHA and H had briefed immediately on the direct mail talks, and had briefed HFAC on the follow on talks. We had asked for time to brief SFRC but had not yet done so.

This should be a good news story. We engaged with the Cubans at the Vice-Minister level, breaking a several year shunning of our Interest Section by the Cubans, traveled outside of Havana to view hurricane damage (thus breaking through the barrier of no travel beyond a ten-mile perimeter), we pursued extradition of US fugitives in Cuba, and most importantly, Bisa Williams (my DAS and the head of delegation) met with a broad range of dissidents, civil socity reps, and bloggers.

This last point is worth highlighting. The last part of the trip came together late because we would not let the Cubans condition our meetings or determine who we could or could not meet with. The Cubans finally allowed us to meet with dissidents, something they have prevented EU and other visitors from doing. In other words, we have broken th mold and put real pressure on others to do the same.

Obama should address the nation as if we are thinking adults who are capable of looking beyond breathless correspondents and combative cable news anchors to the hard challenges of coping with a region in turmoil. As Sen. John McCain observed on TV yesterday, these are momentous, historical events that could transform a region and bring it into the modem age, with potential global significance. The stakes are very high. And we are not in charge of the Arab awakening. Arabs are. Nonetheless, as a global power we can and should play a constructive hand and help shape events.

He should describe the reasons for the U.S. to respond and to act in a differentiated way - in recognition of the Arab world's tremendous diversity. He should explain why we need a differentiated strategy and why a cookie cutter won't work in such a diverse geography.

How to explain this? He should explain what the differences are in the Arab nations affected by this awakening:

-- they differ by the nature of incumbent regimes (transitioning, ugly autocrats, friendly autocrats).

-- they differ by the nature of the societies themselves and especially the opposition forces that are taking to the streets (sectarian, tribal, secular, Islamist, civil society-led, angry unemployed youth, etc.)

-- and they differ by the nature of U.S. interests in various countries, ranging from marginal to decisively important.

Obama should say why a global power must make choices based on interests and priorities, and why we must avoid childish conversations in which we debate whether the U.S. is showing ""hypocrisy"" or ""inconsistency"" when it reacts differently in different cases. Consistency is hardly a virtue if we are consistently wrong.","3","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","1","2"

Interesting exchange. Yellow Fever is a live attenuated vaccine that does cause mild HA, mild myalgias, low grade temperature (<38.5 or 101), in <5% of cases.

In infants < 9 month you generally don't give vaccine for fear of their immature immune response could disseminate the virus and cause an encephalitis (especially <4mo). People who are immunosuppressed from active lymphoma, leukemia, disseminated cancer, or on chemotherapy or post transplant immunosuppressors, should avoid. HIV patients in late stage disease (<cd4 <200) might not immunize, but I have doe it to HIV + with low CD 4 cells (<50) when they had to go into high risk areas and could not avoid mosquitoes. Someone with an allergy to eggs (if they can eat eggs them they should get immunized).

I would also note that protection from yellow fever vaccine is long. It is recommended you boost every by but ""neutralizing antibody"" is known to persist for > 30 years in patients with only one immunization and perhaps for life in those with one or more booster shots.

Just heard Bachelet on TV-- casualties so far 16-- though because communications down and it is still dark information is preliminary. Some concern over risk of Tsunami though Navy deems unlikely. Fortunately, there is no collapse of dams. Considerable damage to highway bridges and infrastructure--that will affect traffic-- in Talca hospital evacuated for precautionary reasons. President declared zones of Maule and Bio Bio disaster areas.

Significant loss of life and damage unlikely because Chile suffered devastating earthquakes in 1939 and 1960 (the strongest in recorded history) in same area so most old construction is gone. Chile has strong construction codes and state of the art anti-earthquake standards. Also Chile has excellent first responder capacity. One concern of course are aftershocks. In 1960 (May 21) a second earthquake occurred day after that caused a Tsunami in Japan. Will have to evaluate whether trip to Chile should proceed. Precisely because of tragedy this may not be time to cancel - provided Chilean side can handle and are anxious for trip to proceed. Suspect that that will be the case.

The army is not getting involving. 2. The army doesn't want to humiliate Mubarak. They will not force him to do anything further. But a flashpoint looms. Egypt can only go for a few more days before there is a food crisis. The army is central to food distribution. Within days as a result of a food crisis the army will feel there must be a resolution. In the meantime, the army will do not anything else. Mubarak has dug in his heels. The army wanted him out, but will not do more against him. The army remains in touch with Muslim Brotherhood, which is not driving the revolution but waiting. The army is still in control.

New options

1. The old constitution established that the president could be president for life. Mubarak could call for a constitutional committee to be formed immediately involving all elements of Egyptian politics to amend the constitution abolishing that provision. Mubarak, in fact, mentioned this in his speech, but failed to include any mechanism to realize it. Calling into being a committee would build on what he has already said and begin to end his rule in reality.

They are definitely in but they are still formulating their more defined role in the Alliance - donor vs implementor.

I recognize that we're most likely going to have a gap in the COM slot in Baghdad.

But if S is seeing Jim Jeffrey, I wonder if she could squeeze him to stay on for just a few more weeks. Not indefinitely, but, say, another month, say until May 1.

This was a terrific idea on your part — and the fact that it now has actually happened is really gratifying as well.

FYI, let me also attach a copy of a recent letter from President Elbegdorj to former President Bill Clinton. Although specifically highlighting the upcoming Nadaam festivities in Ulaanbaatar in mid July, I know that President Clinton would be welcome to visit Mongolia at any time, fulfilling the desire expressed in his ""Foreign Policy"" interview earlier this year that he really does want to ""ride across the Mongolian steppes on horseback""!

"C05767352_0","Baghdad staffing thoughts (PERSONNEL SENSITIVE)","PERSONNEL SENSITIVE

Madam Secretary, given your focus on Baghdad staffing issues, I would like to raise proposals regarding two specific components: 1) Covering the period of Iraqi government formation and summer transition. 2) Selecting Chris Hill's successor.

Iraqi government formation period and summer transition

The Iraqi government formation process will move into full gear in late March, approximately two weeks after the March 7 elections when the official election results will be certified. Embassy Baghdad (with a large number of Arabic-speaking officers) and USF-I will work with Iraqi leaders to promote the formation of an inclusive cabinet that doesn't cross any U.S. red lines. I propose Washington staffing support for the field as follows:

In addition, of course, we would have Washington phone calls, strategic communications messaging, diplomatic outreach to Iraq's neighbors and beyond, and VIP visits to help with the government formation process. But I have concentrated on what we would do to augment staffing in the field in ways that I hope will bolster Washington confidence in our efforts.

Chris Hill's successor

Given your meeting tomorrow with the Vice President where Iraq staffing may come up, I wanted to send you these thoughts quickly. With the exception of NEA PDAS Ron Schlicher, I have not had the opportunity to talk to Bill Burns or others about these ideas.

"C05769566_2","","Colleagues —

The President has decided to nominate Jack Lew, currently the Deputy Secretary of State, to be the next OMB Director.

Like many of you, I have known Jack for many years and value his counsel and friendship.

With his experience, mastery of the budget process, and passion for public service, Jack Lew is an individual especially qualified to serve the President and the American people during these challenging economic and fiscal times.

Moreover, Jack is someone who knows OMB inside and out, having served as a PAD, EAD, Deputy Director, and Director. There are few people in Washington with his experience here and commitment to this organization.

I congratulate Jack on his nomination, and will do what I can to support him, the economic team, and the President as they work to put our country on a sustainable fiscal path. And while I will be leaving OMB at the end of the month, I do so confident that the agency is in good hands.

All the best,

I am writing this note as I head for O'Hare en route to Israel-Palestine. For ten days I'll be with a small group of women to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian human rights and peace activists, with a focus on the work of women. Many things about Israel-Palestine make me very discouraged now, but I am always encouraged when I mingle with the grassroots lovers of peace and people—be they Christians, Muslims, or Jews. At those time I feel as if I have been gifted with a glimpse into God's Kingdom. So I am looking forward to this week.

- CEP spokesperson held a press conference today at the CTV: no information unknown to us was presented, but it was a positive step towards having more transparency for the public

- one possible concern given the current backlog is that results would not be ready by march 31, unless one of 2 things happen: 1. the threshold is raised to reduce the number of PVs needing legal review 2. the legal unit's review capacity is increased. Given the lawyers are already working at high capacity, the only way to do this is by having more lawyers. We understand meetings were held at the CEP today to find ways of addressing this issue.

"C05779935_2","","This may be a crazy idea, but as far as we can tell we need ideas. Suppose we launched a ""Pledge for Palestine"" campaign that copies Warren Buffet's ""The Giving Pledge"" campaign, described below — he's trying to get 40 billionaires to give away most of their money. I had asked some S/P folks to think about how we might take that campaign global to help change the attitudes of elites in places like Pakistan and Latin America, but perhaps Warren Buffet could be convinced to lend his name — or perhaps Michael Bloomberg or Danny Abraham (together with a very wealthy Muslim) to a similar Pledge for Palestine campaign. Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state and could offset the ending of the moratorium for Palestinians (there would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis, who would be building settlements in the face of a pledge for peace). With even 30 calls to the right people in the Clinton fundraising network it should be possible to generate a substantial enough amount quickly enough to capture the public imagination on the heels of the President's speech and, critically, to serve as an expression of global solidarity with the Palestinians and but also a meaningful promise of material improvements for Palestinians on the West Bank. That could significantly bolster Abbas in a way that could help him stay in the talks. This is what diplomacy beyond the state should mean.

Pursuant to our conversation, it seems we have concurrence that we respond to the HFAC staff query (below) via telephone call which I would be pleased to make. (H also agrees it would be best to respond with a call.) Following are talking points for your review and approval:

• Secretary General Insulza's designation and announcement of Gov. Bill Richardson as a special envoy for the OAS was made without any consultation with or consent of the U.S. Mission to the OAS or the Department. In fact, we first heard of the announcement through press reports.

• Upon hearing the news, Ambassador Lomellin immediately raised concern with the Secretary General and expressed our displeasure, as he should have consulted with the USG before making this appointment. We specifically expressed concern that the Governor's views might be misconstrued as representing official U.S. policy, and in particular on the very sensitive issue of U.S.-Cuba policy. Insulza committed that it would not occur.

• Gov. Richardson is a private citizen and his views in no way represent U.S. foreign policy.

• We remain concerned with the implications of this designation in potentially misrepresenting the views of the , U.S. and the Organization of American States, and intend to raise the matter again with Insulza in light of Gov. Richardson's remarks at Brookings on U.S.-Cuba policy.

• It is not a paid position.

Please advise how you wish to proceed. Thanks.

Happy New Year! As you board the plane and prepare to depart, please know that we are deeply grateful for the tremendous effort that you have made to allow the Secretary to participate in Brazil's historic inauguration.

The press here has focused intently on the Secretary's decision to participate, and has given prominent play to the statements that have come out of the White House and the Department describing the importance of our bilateral relationship. The Foreign Ministry and Dilma's transition team have given a very positive spin to the Secretary's role in the inauguration, and made clear that she is very welcome. Among the general public, the news has provoked a deep sigh of relief and is seen as evidence of our willingness to work with the new President and overcome the recent problems that have complicated our relationship.

When the Secretary arrives, she will also find a collection of heads of state looking to have a word with her. The format in PlanaIto will allow this to take place during the ceremony and immediately afterwards. In particular, Colombian President Santos has asked to speak with the Secretary. Also, last night the Peruvian ambassador told me that President Garcia will go to PlanaIto to speak with her. I am sure others will line up to greet her.

The Brazilians have worked hard to meet our logistical and security requirements, and the movements today should be smooth. Of course, if you can convince the pilots to fly fast and get here early it will be better for everyone.

Since then, we have been working closely with the State Department, USAID, the Middle East Investment Initiative (MEII) and Shore Bank International (SBI), to establish a $50 million franchisee lending program in Tunisia. Last week, OPIC and USAID signed an MOU which will provide $1 million in grant assistance today and $4 million in subsequent years to cover operating expenses for MEII/SBI, OPIC's implementing partners in Tunis. Through MEII and SBI, OPIC will provide $50 mill in loan guarantees and technical assistance to local financial institutions, which will lend working capital to Tunisian franchisees interested in partnering with American, European and Tunisian franchisors. We will soon be disbursing to MEII/SBI for them to begin the diagnostics on the local banks for the facility.

As I have said about a number of recent projects, this facility would not have been possible without the keen support of the State Department and USAID, whose staff were a key part of getting this project done. This is yet another example to add to your list of U.S. development agencies combining forces quickly and effectively to advance the U.S. foreign policy and development agenda.

This facility will help small, local entrepreneurs bring new American franchises to Tunisia, and I am proud that OPIC, State and USAID have pulled this together after you called on us to support the MENA region.

The case went all through the Israeli court system and was decided by the Supreme Court. This was not a provocation. If there was a provocation, it was when the illegal squatters stopped paying their rent.

2) Israel objects to the suggestion that this was a violation of the roadmap. Israel requests clarification of what part of the roadmap obligations the U.S. believes were violated.

3) Israel rejects the suggestion that the timing was connected to the Fatah Party Congress. There is no connection.

A key point which Ellen will propose is the creation of a US-Liberian Bi-national Commission to institutionalize the gains in Liberia and ensure that the partnership endures well beyond the present administrations in the US and in Liberia. Such a proposal would allow the priorities (from AFRICOM to food security, MCC) to be categorized, charted, reported on and measured for success.

The Commission would oblige regular meetings and require constant high-level US engagement. Other areas of common concern and shared responsibility such as governance, energy, regional security could be incorporated into such a framework.

The US-Nigerian Bi-national Commission inaugurated in 2010 by Sec. Clinton is a model for consideration.

Given the anticipated departure of Sec. Clinton from the State department, regardless of the outcome of the US election in November, we would trust she would be supportive of such a superstructure to preserve and protect Liberia's future.

But I did response for ABC News to the Republican debate last Sat night, and it just reminded me of the fact that you kicked ass in the debates and more broadly, we had a campaign that changed the country. Just thinking about NH - I mean that was historic. And at least for me, though it's taken a long time, the pain is over and I can feel pride in what we did. And I feel like if we don't take some pride in it, then it paints the whole thing as negative, when it wasn't.

I deal w Plouffe and all these characters regularly, I know what they'll think. I'm happy to say what this is and what it isn't. But people are thinking about 4 yrs ago now because of the Rep primary - so I hate to wait til after the election. But I of course will if you prefer.

No PC has been called yet for Wed 10/20 - though if they do call one during the normal 5 pm slot, that will indeed present a conflict with the Kissinger event. I've will ask for guidance about what we can expect w/Donilon now in charge...both in terms of PCs and whether he intends to continue the small group meetings with you and Gates.

Will check about Adm Mullen's dinner and if it is on Thurs 10/21, whether you can make it back in time.

Re the possibility of Raul Yzaguirre on Tues 10/26 - Sharon Hardy with Ceremonials relayed to Raul that we wanted to offer any date other than 10/21 that worked well for him. He came back with Mon 10/25...even though the Franklin Room is booked that evening. President WJC's schedule does have him coming back from Jamaica to DC on 10/26 - but that may be just because they were trying to match up RONs with you. Let me 1) double check w/WJC's office about where he'll be on 10/26 and 2) determine whether Tues 10/26 is an option for Raul Yzaguirre and/or the Council of La Raza folks

The ""system"" has an interest in self preservation (and I suspect Ben All left because the army and party bosses told him they were jettisoning him). We have an interest in opening up political space.

While the transfer of power to the Parliamentary Speaker puts the interim presidency in more of a gray bureaucrat cog in the system than the PM is, there is a real plus: it acknowledges Ben Ali ain't comin' back.

"C05767213_1","","Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands of political killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in reserve.","1","3","2","2","1","1","1","1","1","1"

Clearly, if the nuclear issue becomes worse these models will need to be updated. The Nikkei fell by about 6.2 percent today, the largest drop since Lehman's insolvency in 2008. The BOJ injected a record 10 trillion Yen (-$200 billion USD) into the markets yesterday to maintain solvency. The Yen dropped below 81 to the USD and is currently at about 82. There are questions about what impact this move will have on the global financial markets.

The outpouring of condolences from the international community and the Afghans for Richard's passing has been extraordinary. We have had a steady flow of visitors from the NATO and diplomatic community and, most importantly, Afghans of every walk of life for several days who have come to sign the condolence book.

Today, during my weekly meeting with President Karzai, I took along the condolence book to be signed at the Palace. President Karzai signed and wrote a nice tribute to Richard and graciously allowed us to bring an Embassy photographer to memorialize the occasion. A photograph is attached. We will separately arrange for a copy to be signed by President Karzai for Kati.

Separately, I would ask that you thank Mike Mullen for permitting the USO show with which he is traveling to stage an unprecedented performance at the U.S. Embassy today. Allowing Embassy Kabul to be the site of a USO show in Afghanistan was very gracious of Mike as normally USO shows are only held at military bases. We had an extraordinary turnout of our civilian and military team from all over Kabul gathered today to see Robin Williams and other entertainers.

Ganzoury said he would be seeing the IMF in a few days (Note: has the IMF not communicated its delay?), but that a program would take a month to build and Egypt needed assistance immediately. He specifically asked whether the US had identified and frozen Mubarak/regime assets that could be tapped, noting that Gulf pledges of aid were not materializing.

The Secretary pointed to Gulf concerns over stability in Egypt and said real concerns were raised by the on-going violence. The images were deeply disturbing, particularly of the women being beaten.

Plassnik is a strong personality and as a former FM might have some difficulty in accepting the limited powers of the Sec Gen position in a consensus-based organization dominated by participating states.

Thank you for your comments about what you would like said at the meeting with Secretary Clinton and Senator Graham. I will try to summarize them for you: first you want to express your appreciation for both her having such a meeting and also for defending religious freedom throughout the world. You also want to express the depth of commitment the faith community has to serving the neediest people in the world and give several examples of what you have done. Maybe most importantly you want to share that in order to work hand-in-hand with the government there needs to be mutual respect and an appreciation for differing religious beliefs, and that these beliefs should also be respected. They should not become barriers to working together and we must make every effort to avoid such conflict. Lastly, you expressed an interest in explaining how you want to impress on legislators the need for robust foreign policy budgets and that you plan to work actively to protect both programs and funding for them. I hope that was a good summary.

We should all meet in the lobby of the State Department at 10:00 sharp Thursday morning.

Thanks for all your hard work on this difficult speech to get it as right as possible. Here are a few comments and questions:

We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure

what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?

The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc.

In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might literally save her life.

As you know the issue of branding continues to be a major challenge. Despite the fact that the USG spends billions of dollars each year administering a broad array of programs and initiatives, there is little recognition among foreign publics of the extent of our investments and assistance. There are literally hundreds of different logos and branding treatments across government departments and agencies with little or no reference to the United States. In many cases, specific branding requirements in contracts with our implementing partners are either waived or ignored. While it is relatively easy to identify the problem, finding a solution is difficult even within our own Department. There are probably a number of reasons for this --- everything from ""institutional egos"" to the need to focus on more Immediate priorities. Yet each day that passes without a resolution of this matter is a day we lose to promote our national interests.

In Zanzibar, after the Embassy sent them a statement reiterating public comments by the White House and the Secretary and reiterating long-standing USG support for Tanzania, another Muslim group canceled its planned demonstration to show appreciation for the embassy's statement. The Somalia unit (based in Nairobi) received statements of support both from the new Somali government as well as Somali radio outlets, in response to Somali-language translations of S and POTUS statements. Across Africa, posts have been distributing and amplifying both S and POTUS remarks, using the most appropriate tools available : via social media, e-mailed statements, and by hand or by phone.

I just gave Melanne Verveer a goodbye hug as she wrapped up her visit to Bangladesh and departed for Nepal. She worked great magic here connecting with Bangladeshis across the spectrum from ministers and Nobel Laureate Md. Yunus to Grameen borrowers and Grameen ""walkers"" (beggar women) whom she met when we visited a village to see Grameen in action. Her genuine warmth and respect for Bangladeshis electrified the villagers and, through expansive media coverage, the nation, as she brought the best of America to the people.

She also used the visit to great effect in delivering a clear message that America cares deeply about Grameen and wants to see Grameen effectiveness and integrity continue undiminished in bringing hope to millions of Bangladesh's most vulnerable, especially poor women. She urged timely selection of a new Grameen managing director who is renowned, respected, above reproach and who has deep passion for the Grameen philosophy. Her message was spot-on, and I am so grateful that she delivered it so effectively.

I assure you Mission Dhaka will arduously build on Melanne's legacy as we work hard and smart to get the government to ensure the next Grameen managing director is the right person to sustain the institution. I hope success in this regard will help create an environment conducive to your visiting Bangladesh, where I would want to take you to a village so you, too, can experience the Grameen magic at work.

- Polls closed on time throughout the country, and counting began in an orderly fashion. Poll closing was more problematic in the Port-au-Prince area; some voting centers obeyed the 5pm extended closing but others did not. There were no reports of violence relating to closing of voting centers. OAS, CNO and other groups report the same overall satisfaction with the voting process.

- U.S. and Canada teams reported across-the-board results in favor of Michel Martelly. Obviously, this is just anecdotal, but so far we have Martelly leading 12,160 to Manigat's 3,311. Local press is beginning to report numbers in favor of Martelly in Port-au-Prince. International press is reporting smoother elections than November 28 and uncertainty regarding turnout. Mulct will make an official statement this evening, but it hasn't been released yet.

- OAS speculates turnout was around the same as November 28, perhaps a little higher because more people were able to find their polling places. It's impossible at this point to make any judgment about turnout.

We will have Embassy people at the CTV starting when it opens tomorrow at 6am.

With over 99.9 percent of the vote in Ukraine counted, Yanukovych leads by 3.5 percent (almost 900,000 votes) and is the clear winner and next president. The Central Election Commission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within ten days; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko, who has been silent publicly, plans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts, but they will not change the result. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite street protests.

Our recommendation is EU Ambassadors in Kiev

have recommended the same approach to Brussels, but want to revisit it if there is no progress by Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today with praise for the conduct of elections, but stopped short of congratulating him on his victory.

He said the recent tough messages by Insulza, OAS Ambassadors and USG officials. strengthened by US sanctions, was having an impact on the M regime. He praised our decision to close the consulate and urged that we also move to take away tourist and business visas from key regime members and supporters. I told him we were working on implementing the visa and other measures which I expected could be announced soon.

Arias was critical of Z saying his recent public statements continued to be unhelpful. He described Z's statement advocating the death penalty (presumably to apply to his political enemies) and asking for the extension of his term in office as ""disastrous"". He said that Insulza had made the right call by not allowing Z to address the OASGA. We agreed the influence of FM Rodas over Z was highly negative,

I told Arias I would be back in Honduras tomorrow and planned in the coming days to press influential political, business and civil society and urge support for the immediate signing of the Si Accord. Arias and I agreed to stay in close touch in the coming days.

I wonder from a contracting and legal standpoint how to react if asked to POGO's suggestion that supervisors are not allowed to work for another contractor.

Reverend Jesse Jackson called me around 6 pm this evening (9/17) to provide a readout of his trip to Gambia to urge President Jammeh to stop the arbitrary execution of death row inmates. The visit appears to have been a success. Rev.

According to our Embassy in Banjul, one of these Americans was convicted of allegedly participating in a coup plot, and the other was allegedly convicted of treason for printing pro-democracy T-shirts. Our Embassy also reports that President Jammeh agreed to release the two Americans provided they return directly to the United States with Rev. Jackson tomorrow. Our Embassy and Ambassador Ned Alford assisted Rev. Jackson and his delegation in Banjul, and are now working with Consular Affairs to expedite the departure of the released Americans.

"C05784651_0","","Hi Cheryl,

First of all, thanks so much for convening the group to discuss our plans for the US Diplomacy Center.

I came away with the impression that everyone who attended felt that it would be an important part of the Secretary's legacy for the foreign service and for all those who work in the diplomatic arena.

We'll look forward to receiving some additional tweaks from S/P on the themes which will be incorporated into the exhibits, as well as to a communications strategy from Philippe.

In the meantime, when you speak to the Secretary about this, you might mention that Secy Jim Baker is very enthusiastic about the Center and has committed $1 million personally, $500,000 of which is already in hand, and has helped us with several companies and spoken personally to Henry Kissinger, who is also helping us. So it is a true bipartisan effort as well as a public/private partnership! Since we need them both on other issues like Law of the Sea, etc., it would be very awkward if we didn't finish the job.

Thanks again for your leadership and support, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hope your trip is going well. Long but useful set of meetings in Kabul today, with side visit to FOB in Wardak. Look forward to discussing in more detail when I'm back, but a few impressions (within limits of this channel):

-- Very helpful for VP to get ground truths from variety of perspectives. He hadn't been here in two years.

-- Meeting with K (incl an hour one on one) was quite cordial. VP went out of way to accentuate positive, talked about strategic alignment between us on 2014, need to manage tactical differences better (PSCs, etc). K in ""up"" mood.

-- VP made public comment afterward about ""not leaving in 2014 and staying as long as Afghans want us to."" He meant enduring strat partnership, not continued combat role, but press already (hot surprisingly) contrasting this to earlier ""we'll be out lock stock and barrel.""

This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but in some respects we're a bit ahead of pace (and in others respects, slightly behind). With respect to scheduling courtesy visits, we've reached out to all Committee members to gauge their interest in a meeting. My suspicion is you're right -- they're all distracted by the debt talks and other associated issues. But the requests tend to spike once a hearing is scheduled, when there's more urgency from their perspective.

Where we're ahead of pace is the review of your nomination materials by Committee Counsels. In that sense, last week's cancelled recess bought us a couple of additional days. As you know, once that review is completed, we're all clear for scheduling a hearing date.

Committee leadership (Majority and Minority) know you're a top priority of the Secretary and the Department. I'm still confident you'll move through the Committee process in a fairly expedient manner. What is harder to gauge is what happens on the floor once your nomination is reported out. Whether we'll be able to resolve whatever issues might arise at that stage is difficult to discern. But I can assure you, we'll pull out all the stops.

And rest assured, while there are other nominees, we play favorites. You're at the top of our priority list. And that doesn't come from just me. Cheryl and of course the Secretary share that sentiment.","2","2","2","2","3","3","3","3","3","3"

The de facto authorities' consultations continued today -- with government agencies, Congress and judicial branch. The meetings just wrapped up. Our sources tell us the process is moving forward and will result in a series of measures Mon-Wed: some govt resignations and replacements; possible announcement of Dec 2 or 3 for Congressional action on Z issue; M ""step aside."" We have reiterated that latter is crucial for our diplomacy to boost election support. The de factos say the M speech announcing that is being drafted.

De facto negotiators say the military played a useful role today in pushing the process forward.

Amb Llorens notes that while the de facto consultations may look like a stall, the tendency to seek this sort of buy-in is one reason Honduras historically has been more peaceful than its neighors. While our role on the most sensitive issue is not known outside of very few people, the impression is growing in the country and among careful observers in region that something is happening. Insulza told Arturo today that he wants to find a pragmatic way forward and could use a fig leaf. We hope to produce something more than that. Z's negotiators are aware something is moving and appear keen to get back in the game, but Z has them on a tight leash and refuses to play. If things go well in next few days, we will ask S should call Z to encourage him back to the table.

We are in constant touch with the de factos to help keep this on track. While most Hondurans want to move on, there is still a great deal of polarization that makes progress complicated.

I told him about our ""Kissinger-esque"" planning for the 2011 S trip under Kurt's leadership - which delighted him and got him telling a few stories about his own Beijing adventure. Maybe these are old yarns, but I had no idea that he spent the nearly two days with Chou En-lai without bringing up the Nixon visit - he waited until the latter finally asked ""What about the visit?"" to which Dr. K coyly replied ""What visit?""

He's looking forward to seeing Thein Sein next week (asked if I would be there; I explained ASSK travels - but said I thought Derek might be there). He's interested in going to Burma in October (from Singapore) and might contact S with his interest. I know October is packed with visitors, but I encouraged his general interest - noting that his China experience would in particular resonate with the reformist GOB. He asked if it could be done in a day, but agreed with me that he'd really need to do NPT and not just Rangoon. I'm not sure if he will follow up on this - but his mind was so sharp on all matters that I'm compelled to share this all with you tonight! Regards -

"C05789962_1","","This is a follow up from my earlier email. We will pull together in cable tomorrow.

We have a readout of the Tantawi meeting with the political parties from a participant. . The group will reconvene on Thursday mid-day. Tantawi called in about 15-18 political party figures, to focus on the constituent assembly. SCAF told those gathered it was important to move beyond the crisis, start a dialogue and show Egyptians they can find a solution. The SCAF was politely showing the FJP that it had gone too far. Liberals complained they had been shut out of the process. In the end, it seemed as if the FJP was looking at what they might do to allay fears about the constitution. The elections for the constitutional assembly were over, so there was no going back on that. But options on the table — which we have heard from other liberals — would be endorsing a ""bill of rights"" to be incorporated into the constitution. Participants seemed pleased that the SCAF was playing a positive role. More meetings to follow.

Another idea is taking shape of the idea of a trip for a broad group of parliamentary leaders to the US in a ""getting to know you"" visit. We will pursue that.","2","2","1","1","2","3","2","2","2","2"

You will see that in spite of our efforts to protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.

We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia), LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of Sean.

We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference.

(It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that we would not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.

We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to vote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary, while conducting outreach with Tanzania, Zambia, and the AU to explain that we have our own imperatives but we support the fact that they are taking a principled stand.

We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision, which would allow them to be seated and vote but would not formally grant credentials. For the moment, the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practice with respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.

I will do a report when I can. Much of the discussion was about the SPD in now familiar terms, with Graham getting emotional at times and all (McC, Graham, Sessions, Hoeven and Blumenthal) pressing K, McCain intervening at several points to calm Graham down. Graham told K flatly no SPD without process solutions on detentions and night raids; if that's not what he can accept, Americans will not support and he can forget it. K was obstinate and offensive, if calm, blaming the conflict on the US and twice describing US as occupiers— right after saying he is committed to the partnership. At one point he let slip that ""the country that the US wants as an Ally must be sovereign."" He also said that he is opposed to an Afghan detentions regime, and acknowledged that he had blocked what we regard as solutions on the legal framework for detentions, implying he would do so again. By the end Graham was fuming — and made a personal plea to K to do the right thing for the Afghan people. Noting K's repeated assertions that he wants the partnership, McCain observed that those who want an agreement usually find a way to get it and thought the message to K from his best friends in Congress would be useful, he'd need time to process.

The USAID Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recently has completed a review of our Afghanistan Bank Supervision assistance activities. The OIG is set to release its report soon, probably next week.

However, I have been informed that the. Washington Post plans to publish an article on the OIG review of the USAID contractor advising the Afghan Central Bank on bank supervision - Deloitte Touche LLP. The article may appear in the March 13th Sunday edition. Deloitte trains Afghan bank examiners as part of its larger contract implementing our Economic Growth and Governance Initiative, which provides broad policy advice to the Afghan government.

I support the independence of our OIG and the audit community. They represent a vital check on all USG activities both home and abroad. As Administrator, I have made it a central goal to improve oversight of all USAID activities world-wide. I have directed the implementation of the Accountable Assistance for Afghanistan Initiative in order to ensure more stringent control and oversight of USG funds.

During the evening of March 20 individuals with access to the French and British military and security leadership stated in confidence that French President Nicolas Sarkozy plans to have France lead the attacks on Libya's Muammar Qaddafi over an extended period of time. According to these individuals, Sarkozy is genuinely concerned about the possibility that Qaddafi's troops will commit genocide against the people of Benghazi. However, he also sees this situation as an opportunity for France to reassert itself as a military power. French military commanders were extremely disappointed when, what they believe to be, political differences between the United States and France prevented them from participating in the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. Sarkozy and his military advisors believe that operations in Libya will rebuild the reputation of the French military, which was also damaged by a problematic performance in the first Gulf War.

(Source Comment: For his part. British Prime Minister David Cameron is concerned over how the allies will deal with the rebel forces, if, and when, they take advantage of the air attacks on Qaddafi's forces to renew their move on Tripoli. British intelligence believes that when the rebels recapture Ras Lanuf and other towns they will find evidence of atrocities committed by Libyan troops against the local population.

Thank you for the status update - we appreciate it.

In response to your question regarding assuring ""accelerated declassification of all of the HAK documents in the Library of Congress, not just those that have been referred to State by the Archives"", the short answer is that we cannot.

I can inquire as to whether we could consider developing a plan that is consistent with our proposal and our reviewing authorities that might enable us to work the additional collection of non-State records while we are do our State records work; such a proposal would obviously involve incremental funding based on the scope of such a plan. It also would require the engagement of other agencies. Obviously I am not certain if such a proposal could work, because as we shared in the meeting between the Secretary and HAK at their meeting, we are not in a position to address other agencies' records.

Sandy's email is down temporarily. He asked that I forward the following to you:

The domestic firestorm would be the same, regardless of the language. Congress will not parse the words; they will take the view that this is throwing Israel overboard. D's as well as R's. That will have consequences for the generally bipartisan support of our handling of Egypt, and put the Administration on the defensive. It will be seen as backtracking on our position—restated as recently as last week by Jim—that the UNSC is not the place to litigate these issues.

Undoubtedly, vetoing a resolution that echoes US policy hurts our credibility in the region and undercuts the forward-leaning posture we have cultivated over the past three weeks. That could feed the anti-American currents and manifest itself on the streets of Ramallah or elsewhere.

Obviously, better if we can get the Pals to withdraw, including holding out the prospect of putting forward TORs for negotiations. But if that is not successful, I come down—narrowly--on the side of veto. I know what happens here if we abstain; I am not sure what happens in the region if we veto.

If that is where you come out, it may be better not to change the language. And we certainly should try to get something from Bibi—on the g round or in his negotiating positions.

"C05739878_0","Latest from HRC friend","Jake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinking and machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption but wouldn't be surprised.

On the federalism issue,. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A cabinet chance won't solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to take on the Bardans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeid tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing their beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.

The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't already doing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentary elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had calmed down).

It was a natural partnership given the environmental qualities of natural gas and the Conservancy initiatives. Donna also was quite active in the Arkansas chapter of The Nature Conservancy. One of the unique strengths of the Nature Conservancy is their strong state network organizations. I am sure that The Nature Conservancy dinner marking their 60th anniversary this Fall will be a well organized and special occasion.

"C05777978_1","Egypt: Communications Issues","In the larger scheme of things, the communications issues implicated by events in Egypt are not nearly as significant as others. While they are important, they should not receive undue emphasis. That said, there are two admittedly obvious points that warrant mention:

1. The Government of Egypt has engaged in the most extensive shut down of the Internet in history. The only reasonably close analogies are efforts that were undertaken in Iran and Burma, but these were not nearly as extensive as what has occurred in Egypt. Just as important, the Government of Egypt has shut down other electronic communications almost completely. The only general exception is the wireline telephone system. The relative narrowness of this exception can be seen in the fact that there are roughly six times more now disconnected mobile subscriptions than wireline. Thus, while there has been considerable focus on the shutting down of the social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), what has taken place is much more significant.

2. The costs to any modern society of shutting off electronic communications are incalculably large. They include not only the economic costs, but also large non-monetary costs to individuals who, for example, are unable to learn the whereabouts and circumstances of relatives and friends. There does not seem to me to be any possibility that disconnecting almost all electronic communications can be sustained for long. The costs to the social fabric and to the economy are much too large. It is an action that, unless reversed almost immediately, will become a very powerful independent, universally felt grievance against the government.

He hopes that a similar economic analysis of food insecurity will be carried forward by an informal working group launched at this Feb 28th meeting, which would then hopefully be considered by Rio+20 and the G20.

Romney's insistence that the economy is in steep decline as a result of Obama's policies is more than central to his political argument—it is at the heart of his identity in this campaign.

He must be the turnaround man.

3. Romney's argument, method and even identity are all bound up in his key point—that he is the turnaround man—and can be crushed by refuting it. Obama should assert that the economy is now in turnaround, cite the 7.8 unemployment and other relevant statistics, observe that Romney has admitted he was ""completely wrong"" on the 47 percent, underscore that Romney is ""completely wrong"" on the true state of the economy, that he has the data ""completely wrong,"" is operating from false premises, and that his approach would hurt people and hurt the economy.

The IL-76s that flew in to Kant today were the EMERCOM/M4C planes he told me about yesterday; they have humanitarian cargo, primarily doctors and medical equipment. I cited the news reports that a battalion of paratroopers had gone in -- he said there may be some troops on board to guard the plane or beef up security at Kant, but he was firm that at this point Russia has no plans to introduce its own forces in the south. The main objective was to stop the violence through peaceful means; Russia had provided the Kyrgyz forces with additional ""technical means"" for accomplishing that. He said they hoped this would help Kyrgyz forces get control of the situation, which was their main goal.

This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic material of the country.

And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able to secure?

But this security breach is not a targeted breach to make a whistle blower point, it is a wholesale leak that should be treated as putting lives in danger.

The Passing of Ambassador Jerome Shestack

I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend Jerry Shestack. He was a committed public servant and a dogged defender of human rights. Countless women and men are better off because of Jerry.

Jerry served the cause of human rights for more than half a century. He made a lasting impression as Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission where he launched the U.N. Working Group to investigate disappearances under oppressive regimes. Under President George H.W. Bush, he served with distinction on the delegation to the Moscow Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and on the Presidential-Congressional Commission to Improve the Effectiveness of the United Nations.

As President of the American Bar Association and in the years following he set the standard for how civil society leaders can promote human rights.

He was unwavering in his commitment to the highest of American values and international, human rights standards. Jerry was an effective advocate for the causes—and people—he cared about because he had a rare mix of wonderful qualities: optimism, resilience, humor, a thick skin, and a way of making everyone feel at ease.

Today my thoughts and prayers are with Jerry's beloved wife, Marciarose, and their two children, Jennifer and Jonathan.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"

After consulting the Senator, I informed Molho that, in seeking delay, we would like to provide the Quartet with an Israeli commitment to meet the following week. He said that was reasonable but wanted to check with the PM. In a later conversation, he said he still thought it would be ok, but said the PM wanted to consult the FM, and he (Molho) would get back to me in the morning.

After hearing from Molho tomorrow, I plan to convene an envoys call to propose we delay both the Israeli and Palestinian meetings one week, and hold them in Jerusalem/Ramallah. I expect the others will push to proceed as planned with the Palestinians, and then meet later with Molho. So long as we can point to a confirmed Israeli meeting, I'm not sure it matters much either way, but overall more delay, the better.

Try this for size: ""The United States can, must and will lead in the new century."" In order to do that, Clinton promised ""a new global architecture,"" ""built to last and withstand stress."" And in a muscular departure from the way in which this administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: ""Democracy needs defending.""

I am en route to Brazil with the Treasury Secretary. As I return to a week full of events (including our Economic Partnership Dialogue, a visit by Nancy Powell, and the White House pre-advance team), I wanted to take a moment to thank the Secretary and you for the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference.

I had a great time. The conference was substantive, relevant, and timely. I appreciated the big chunk of time the Secretary dedicated to the conference, especially during a time of perilous crisis. I also appreciated the opportunity to listen to Admiral Mullen and the Vice President. And I enjoyed the unique moment of camaraderie with all of my counterparts (even if some of them were whiney).

And...I thought the presentation by Mr. Spence to be a stroke of genius. It scrambled everyone's expectations of the conference and forced us to look at what we were doing in a very different way. The presentation is on its way to becoming an urban legend within the bureaucracy. One Treasury official told me today, ""I heard about the Spence presentation. Very interesting. Not the kind of thing we would do at Treasury.""

I have tried to solve this with 3 Presidents and 3 Secretaries of State, yet I have been met by same old answers and zero willingness to help these families. Hillary, if I can't resolve this with you, I will never be able to resolve it. Like you, I believe in the fierce urgency of now.

I have gotten to know some of these families. Julian Bartley was the highest ranking African American as Consul General serving in Nairobi His son, Julian Jr. was interning at the Embassy that summer. Jay's body was cut in half in the explosion. He would have been 35 years old this October. Other victims left young children. One of the injured was blinded and contracted HIV while being treated in a Kenyan Hospital. I know you want to help these families as much as I do.

I got strong language in the Foreign Aid Appropriations bill that requires State to report on US victims of terrorism, and to draft a plan for providing compensation. I want to use this report and info to draft comprehensive legislation to provide compensation to American victims of terrorist attacks.

I need you to give me a high level, fresh person to work with at the State Department to resolve this issue. Someone who will come in the room with the willingness to offer solutions. We just need some fresh ideas and the will to put these ideas into action. I know we can do it.

2. Afghan National Security Forces are also engaged with four insurgents at a three-story building behind the Kabul Star. Security forces have cleared two of three floors. As government forces attempt to clear the third and final floor of the building, small arms fire is likely to increase significantly. One of the four has been killed and one is wounded.

I was heartened to read your forceful remarks about the US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region this morning.

Also, in early June, we are holding two workshops with US policy makers (one for Democrats and one for Republicans) to illuminate how contingencies in Pakistan might affect US-China relations. I will give you a read out on those events as well.

(Comment: all the evidence demonstrates that Ouattara won and Gbagbo lost.)

I am now at my desk. I agree with concerns below. The cementing of the monopoly by Preval for the public container port is a prime example how elite capture runs directly counter to job creation and social welfare.

Assets (land, heavy equipment, cement, petroleum) that are in high demand during a construction boom are in the hands of a few. The risk is that price spikes will severely drive out the potential gains from aid dollars. Dual signatures and injecting foreign experts into a HRA task force to review projects for eligibility will counteract obvious forms of corruption.

The much harder task is to determine realistic benchmarks for project costs, given transfer pricing and de facto cartels. Injecting competition and open bidding is needed to counteract this. The problem is that any Haitian firm will loose business to US or Chinese contractors with much more favorable pricing structures (but limited spillovers to local economy). A middle ground may be to invite joint ventures between Haitian and international companies to build up the local workforce and overall skill base.

Last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I spoke out against the trade in ""conflict minerals"" that has funded a cycle of conflict there that has left more than 5 million people dead since 1998, displaced countless more, and spawned an epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.

President Obama has now signed into law a measure that will require corporations to publicly disclose what they are doing to ensure that their products don't contain these minerals. The DRC has formally expressed its support for this law and has thanked both the executive and legislative branches of our government. This is one of several steps we are taking to stop this illicit and deadly trade.

After my visit to the Congo, I directed the State Department to develop a holistic strategy on this issue as part of our broader effort to engage effectively with the DRC.

Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every turn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk (the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed, Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and statebuilding budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the way the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here.

Sorry I was not able to be at the meeting last week.

I just read the WSJ piece and I have to say that I find the continued attacks upon DoS with respect to Internet circumvention very troubling. We have said on may occasions that we strongly support BBG's efforts to obtain additional funding for circumvention tools. However, I worry that the seemingly endless attempts to undermine what DoS is doing in this critical area will impede the efforts you and I are making to bring our two organizations closer together. I was particularly troubled by the following quote from the WSJ piece:

""Some of the dysfunction in State Department priorities is structural. VOA and the other broadcasting services were independently run by the U.S. Information Agency from the 1950s until the early 1990s, when for the brief ""end of history"" moment after the Cold War it seemed these efforts were no longer as important. USIA was disbanded, but the diplomats of the State Department have little interest in upsettinaother countries by defendina broadcasting or circumvention efforts.""

As you know, the Secretary has been very forceful in her defense of internet freedom and international broadcasting. She has spoken publically on this issue a number of times and all of us have raised it, and will continue to raise it, in our meetings with government representatives at the highest level. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in working with me on this and in ensuring that our fellow governors and respective staffs are on board as well.

"C05794439_2","","All,

Here's Nahla's quick read-out of how Al Jazeera framed the interview.

Nahla says Mr. Hussein gave a very strong interview. She thought he very effectively quoted an earlier Egyptian interlocutor calling for reason and peaceful solutions. He also quoted Koranic verses on non-violence, forgiveness, and not killing, which should play very well with the audience though it was met with a rather hostile reaction from the interviewer, who seemed caught off-guard.

After the interview, AJ news reported that Mitt Romney is getting criticized by other Republicans for taking advantage of the crisis for political motives.

Following the news, there was an interview with Dr. Mohamed Al-Jawadi, a historian and political analyst who was asked if Secretary Clinton's statements are enough to stem the tide of outrage. He said the State Department has achieved cooperation with the Islamic work by supporting and respecting the people's aspirations and now has strong relationships based on mutual respect and respecting laws, but there are those in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and the US who wish to destroy that cooperation. When asked how to prevent future violent incidents at US Embassies, he emphasized the importance of strong judicial institutions to address charges of breaking laws and denigrating religions, so the cases may be settled within legal systems. Educating people about religions and dispelling misconceptions, especially about Islam, is also very important.

Last week Senator Murkowski (R-Alaska) spoke to White House contacts and indicated she was considering changing her vote on my confirmation. She has asked to meet me, and an appointment is being sought. Additionally, I had a very good conversation with Senator Menendez, who is now very engaged and is in the process of reconfirming Senator Rubio's position as a ""Yes"" on my vote. Further, Menendez indicated he will be approaching a couple of Republicans asking them to support me.

The objective is to obtain a total of 10 Republican votes. If we can persuade Senator Murkowski, and Senator Rubio reconfirms his positive intent, we believe we have a total of 8 votes.

Rev Jackson wants to go to Moscow and Damascus, to try to get the bloodshed to stop. I encouraged the former and discouraged the latter, cautioning him that Bashar would distort his message and play up the visit in a damaging well. I suggested as well that he speak to Kofi Annan, especially given Annan's concern (as demonstrated in his press remarks) that there be a single point of contact for negotiating with the regime. We don't want Bashar to play Annan and Jackson off each other.

2. The regime reserve the right to respond proportionally (supposedly the first time it has agreed to this) to any attacks

3. Will redeploy its forces to certain encampment areas and bases, particularly in the governates of aDmsscus, Horns, and Hama.

4. Request updates from the JSE on his efforts with the ""other parties"" (i.e., opposition).

Qidwa admitted that this may all be a trick or ply to prevent a Russian rapprochement with the UNSC, but said the letter was more straightforward and factual than making excuses. He thought it could represent a new political position, rather than just another tactic. A/S Feltman remained skeptical. Qidwa admitted that, assuming this was true, there were still two schools of thought within the JSE office with respect to monitoring: some wanted to have a ceasefire in place ahead of time, others (like Qidwa) believe that monitors could help improve things on the ground even if things were still ""messy."" The letter apparently made no reference to shabiha or other security elements, which Qidwa admitted was a problem.

We will work with WHA and USTR to get these turned around and back to the committee on Monday. The staff have told us that they don't intend to block her and aren't holding her but they won't agree to add her. Once we get the responses back to the committee we will press them again to add her.

While most of the questions they sent us have to do with trade with Uruguay, of note is the last question in the list which asks about Julissa's role in trying to free Alan Gross from jail. Our answer to that should be matter of fact and lay out the steps Julissa has taken but this is a place where Lugar hasn't gone before and makes me think he is carrying some water for Rubio here.

"C05790125_0","Heads Up","I got a call a few minutes ago from Ned Martel of the Washington Post. He is doing a story on an alleged White House contemplation with replacing Tim Geithner with Hillary Clinton. His angle was that, among other things, they decided not to pursue it because of the prospect of moving a substantial percentage of the Clinton team to Treasury and the relentlessness with which Cheryl Mills pursued the December 2008 agreement between the President-elect Obama and Senator Clinton about her prerogatives in forming her own team. I told her we dealt with a steady diet of rumors about the VP swap, but I never heard this rumor. I also suggested by the time Tim allegedly offered to leave, HRC was arguably the administration's most effective performer (along with Gates). It was highly unlikely the President would want to break up that tandem that was working so well. When he mentioned trouble with the White House over placements, I said there was a joke going around Washington that Clinton campaign supporters were more successful in getting jobs in the Obama administration than Obama campaign staffers. At the end of the process, Cheryl Mills was very effective in building a team that has worked successfully on behalf of the President and Secretary.

As you know, the Bush Administration consistently hid and defended actions by Turkey that were injurious to Cyprus and Greece, inconsistent with American values and principals, and also not in Turkey's best interests.

We highlighted for the top leaders in our community that Secretary Clinton once again in front of the Turkish Foreign Minister, called for a ""bi-zonal and bi-communal federation"" for Cyprus as well as expressed the United States' strong support for ""freedom of religion.""

With Secretary Clinton and others doing these kinds of things, America is moving to correct the biggest road block to a Cyprus settlement — restoring American credibility with the Greek-Cypriots which was badly lost during the Bush Administration.

I wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today's column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it will be close to or at the top of the media's attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican's have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem. All best, your friend, Jamie

We understand that the French Foreign Minister is speaking with S tomorrow morning, and he is expected to raise the Global Fund. We are preparing to submit the following point for S briefing book, but Eric and I wanted to be sure you were comfortable:

Key Point If Asked About the Global Fund

We need to move together quickly to make ensure that the Fund has the right leadership and management to successfully implement its reform agenda and continue its vital work of saving lives at this critical time.

Background

The High Level Panel which examined the Global Fund's fiduciary controls, as well as other internal reviews, have heavily criticized the Executive Director (a French National, championed by President Sarkozy) for weak management of Secretariat operations, a fractured relationship with the Fund's Inspector General and insufficient attention to oversight of funds. The U.S. position is that the Fund needs an outstanding management team in place to implement the necessary reforms that USG and others have championed.

We believe the Executive Director must be replaced expeditiously and honorably, with no more than a six-month transition during which a Board-appointed turnaround team would provide core management of the Fund.

We need a Board consensus for action, and the Board is meeting on November 21-22.

We understand discussions on the communiqué continued after the press conference. Our EU contacts here are pessimistic that communiqué language will be agreed. Will pass on any further insight as we get it.

Jim Jones just called to tell me he remembered a food distribution system the Air Force used in Bosnia. They dropped cardboard boxes w/out tops filled w MREs from the backs of low-flying C-130s. The air pressure caused the meal packages to inflate so they floated to the ground. They did that every night for months w/out any injuries on the ground, feeding thousands of people. He's asked the Air Force to plan to do that here, and I urged him to push for the decision to be made to try this by Tuesday night. He's also told Gates and Mullen about this and expressed surprise that no one else recalled it being done.

I told Gen. Jones I was going to tell you about it so we could consider and assist in execution if plan went forward.

I made the call to Dep Hayes tonight. According to Hayes- as Sec Salazar is increasingly involved in Arctic issues (domestic related to oil and gas) he wants to use his Copenhagen trip as a chance to meet his counterparts —nothing formal. Hayes then suggested that Sec Salazar could have a meeting with his counterparts from the Arctic Council. I suggested that this was not a good idea as a meeting with the Arctic council group could easily take on unintended formality and confusion. I had already let him know that Secretary Clinton is the US representative to the Arctic Council. I suggested that bilaterals with those Arctic Council member counterparts who might be available would be a better way to have informal introductory meetings. We will try to work with Interior to set some these up. Sec Salazar's particular interest is research related to the Arctic. Sec Salazar has shortened his stay in Copenhagen to the 9th and 10th. Hayes will be there with him and stay on through the 11th

"C05764466_2","","Dear Cheryl,

Thank you for the call on Thursday and for your understanding about my need to take care of certain responsibilities before I depart as SCSL Prosecutor.

The Taylor testimony is going well from our point of view. He is opening himself to a devastating CX by telling unexpected and unnecessary lies about his activities in Liberia and the region. I have been using my access to senior Liberian, Sierra Leone, and UN officials to obtain new evidence with which to confront him. This is well in hand and I dont see a problem in leaving even if Taylor is still on the stand on September 7. The major reason to stay as Prosecutor until that date (aside from the requirement of a 30-day notice to the UNSG) is the oral argument on the appeal of our last case in Freetown (involving historic gender violence convictions) on September 2, 3, and 4.

However, from my conversations with Clint, I am concerned that there are several issues that are coming to head at this time, and know that I will have to hit the ground very fast on September 8. Because my schedule is light in the coming week and because I have some leave days to use, I have therefore planned a quick trip to DC to be there from Wednesday noon through Saturday noon, August 26-29. I wont yet move into the office, but the staff will help me schedule some informal meetings on several issues. Additionally, this will give me a chance to look for a place to live.

It's not that useful in that it emphasizes how important GSP is for Brazil and the products from Brazil that come into the US duty free. I have asked our folks to broaden this out so that it captures data for all 131 countries that benefit from GSP. Focusing on Brazil alone really just plays into Lautenberg's argument that GSP is important to Brazil, so he should keep a hold on the legislation. But, one thing on the attached that is useful. In the last para, it says that close to 90 percent of Brazil's GSP exports are intermediate products — 25-50 percent of which are intercompany transfers between US companies and Brazilian affiliates. That underscores the importance of GSP to manufacturers based in the US, who rely on GSP for their manufacturing here and, by extension, the jobs that this manufacturing supports.

"C05769409_1","","Meghann,

A couple of ideas.

1. To avoid a coordination nightmare, try to get a structure in which there is a single authority with some temporary power - e.g. a senior Haiti figure (ex-PM would be ideal) + Bill Clinton, as co-CEOs, supported by a council where you can put the key parties on so they dont feel excluded (e.g. EU which will otherwise sulk). It could start from the April Plan and the US Plan.

2. To scale up basic service provision without doing a total bypass of the state, I suggest the Public Service Agencies model that I have been working up for the OECD. Essentially, centralized funding of decentralized provision. Fortuitously, this has just been endorsed by the Davos Global Agenda Council for Fragile States and will be pitched as one of the key ideas at Davos. I attach the brief Davos write-up of the idea, and a fuller paper that I did recently for the OECD. Please circulate as you think fit.

I mentioned this to D(L) today in the Thursday staff meeting, and I'd be grateful to have guidance from the Secretary.

The NSC has asked if there is a ""State position"" on whether to invite Saleh or not. I would be very interested to know whether S feels strongly one way or another.

I know the book Dead Aid well. The ideas are not new. They are essentially the same ones that Bill Easterly has proposed in his two books: The Elusive Quest for Growth and White Man's Burden. The essential argument is that a top-down, ""big-plan"" approach to foreign assistance — the Jeff Sachs' approach - has not worked in the past and will not work in the future.

Both Easterly and Moyo argue for a bottom-up approach that supports overall economic growth. They emphasize expanding access to capital markets and low-cost financing, promoting better governance and accountability, policy reform to enhance foreign investment, and support for market-driven social entrepreneurs.

I will give Nora a couple of articles for you to take home and look at. One of them, by Paul Collier, offers a strong alternative to the USAID approach of funding small holder farmers. The other is by Dambisa Moyo and will give you an overall flavor of her perspective.

It's more important than any invitation from me, as it is the last Baccalaureate of Shirley's tenure as the first woman president of Princeton. She has transformed the institution in so many ways and this would be such a great way to start her final graduation ceremony. You may remember when WJC did Class Day, which is also an important part of our final ceremonies; he had a big impact. The Baccalaureate address is generally more serious and really the closest thing we have to having a graduation speaker, as we have no speaker other than the president (of the university) for the graduation ceremony itself. It is done in the chapel, with all seniors in the building and all the parents who can't fit in outside watching on screens. When I was dean I always found it to be one of the most moving ceremonies of the year (also fabulously multi-denominational).

I have my fingers firmly crossed; this would mean a great deal. Although to be honest, I have to admit that if I succeed in being the next president of Princeton (I am firmly in the running), this will definitely not be the LAST time I urge you to come visit and speak!

Four factors—the President's vulnerabilities, at home and therefore abroad; the weakness (if not weirdness) of the GOP field; the preoccupations of Treasury (and the underwhelmingness of its Secretary); and the retrenchment of U.S. hard power—combine make Hillary's strength all the more formidable, in her own right as a powerful person but also as SecState and the steward of a foreign policy that is doing quite well across the board, and, of course, the non-negligible possibility that she might still be president.

What I'd recommend is not to come near this point in the discussion on Monday. But it's something that Hillary should be made aware of it, not to flatter just so she knows this is the way seen. Knowing that will give her confidence to go beyond the usual bounds in setting her agenda and the usual scope of SecState's activity.

To boil it down to an unspoken subtext of the Monday meeting, because of who she is, how she's doing, how she's regarded, she's better positioned to lead economic statecraft than any previous Secretary and anyone else in the current administration.","3","2","2","3","2","3","2","2","1","2"

There are also issues of size and style of the brand, e.g. the flag, as USAID and its partners work out the aesthetics.

If there is a major political prisoner release tonight we need to be ready to respond, particularly given ethnic announcements today.

If they do 655 (as AFP reports, or even a relatively smaller number) and that includes a decent amount from our list of notables, and a sufficient number of ""political prisoners"" we need to probably convene tomorrow on next steps. Challenge will be getting confirmation from multiple sources that the release is of the right composition. After post confirms, we probably need to move on the ""action for action"" ledger on Ambos, survey team, and other things on the list developed prior to S visit.

We need to determine if existing press guidance is sufficient if a major release happens. Could be as easy as just putting a warm statement at the top and using existing guidance, or being more robust and forward leaning.

With McConnell, McCain and Liberman in Burma in the next 7-9 days they will likely be our first line of senior-level validation with the government. We need to make sure we work with their teams to arm them with proper pressers and also help shape their messaging. Does Thurston deploy to NPT to note our support? Does Derek cycle back to NPT? We need to start the list of questions and issues to think through.

Other than from the U.S., and usually from the UK, there has been, at most, strong reluctance in the Quint to support BP use -- even when there are direct challenges to Dayton and the functionality of the BH state. We have also sensed some Quint backsliding on 5+2. Although he missed the opportunity you gave him to make the pitch directly, he later asked me to convey to you his hope that the Secretary would be willing to help shore up European support for 5+2 and BP with key PIC colleagues -- especially from Quint countries (Germany, France, Italy in particular).

It goes beyond that. For the hardliners this is almost a religious struggle against a Zelaya they view as dangerous, duplicitous and vengeful. As one of the hardliners told me two weeks ago: ""We are prepared to die for this.""

The modest silver lining is that the military has weighed in on the side of the moderates -- the latter include all three of the de facto negotiators who reached the October 30 Accord.

Hugo believes strongly that I should fly down Tuesday morning for one last, blunt effort. Arturo, Dan Restrepo and I agree. Last time my message, while firm, appealed to M's better angels -- the chance to leave office as a statesman and deal a strategic defeat to Chavez. I will sharpen it tomorrow. The hardliners fail to see how they are playing into the hands of the worst actors in the hemisphere -- ALBA crowing will be part of the de facto legacy. I will also make clear that if the de factos continue down this path we will be forced to underscore our position on the coup in concrete ways

We immediately phoned contacts close to M and warned that if M reneged, we would launch a massive round of visa revocations, to include families. A couple hours later, sources began to report that M had decided definitively to step aside as announced. Former President Maduro played a key role in persuading M to keep his promise.

Later, Panamanian VP/FM Varela called me to say he had heard from his private sector contacts in Honduras that M had ""ratified"" the decision to take a leave of absence.

While I'm still concerned about leaks regarding US interventions coming from the Prime Minister's office, since I have raised it with him, a phone call from S might help. I do not believe PM has a deciding vote, and the more important calls would be to Tantawi (I think it should be from Gates) and Sami Enan in MOD.

We're going to forward with the doubling of mobile access to email and productivity tools. It's INSANE that fewer than 1 in 5 state Department are able to access their email or documents when they're away from their desk. It has contributed to the 9:00-5:00 culture here and exacerbates the disconnection between D.C. and the missions. This is a good short-term win and by my estimates will produce new fewer than 624,000 more hours of productivity by end of year one which I think is extremely conservative — it assumes just 1.5 additional hour online per employee per week. Given that those being given the tools are principally foreign service officers and people more senior than the mean average DoS employee, I think this is very reasonable. Will put an evaluative instrument into this to see if I'm correct. More detail on all this below if you want it.

I should point out that Pat Kennedy and the CIO have been great. This has been one of several instances where they listened, they got it, and they're moving forward.

On both issues, the Dutch are our strong partners. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity I have had to be a part of the Obama administration on the Clinton team, working to improve our relationships all over the world.

STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.

The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean. The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to move. HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio that would generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce. Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first instance is on recess and the ""duty court"" judge will need to take action, but magistrates in Rio are keenly aware of the status of the case and may be prepared to move this evening. BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must happen tomorrow morning. What we don't know: No details yet on what else is contained in the order, which is likely to affect the next steps taken by the Brazilian family.

To update you, at G we have been working on water and World Water Day (the event planned takes place at the National Geographic Building), since I am taking on water as the key issue I am/will working on. I sent S a memo on water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the ""Water for the Poor"" Act.

I have met with Kerri-Ann, with OES ""water"" staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau A/S (Carson, Feltman, Blake so far) on water in the respective regions. There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.

We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank ""experts"" leading NGOs, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.

NEW INFORMATION

About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.

It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.","3","1","3","3","1","1","3","2","2","1"

The development community is despairing. They believe that the longer the agency goes leaderless, the more it de facto becomes simply a part of the State Department. And however well USAID is being overseen now by State, it is important to preserve an independent development assistance and humanitarian aid function that is distinct from considerations that influence diplomatic and foreign policy decisions. There is even a certain ""healthy tension"" between development and diplomatic perspectives. Being at the World Bank gave me a fascinating education in the dynamics and differences between Treasury, State and USAID views and priorities.

Enough on what you already know! I do understand that you're doing all you can to get AID resolved, so I should simply encourage. So consider yourself cheered on!

Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent him by aircraft to Costa Rica.

Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of the Central American Integration System.

The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras on Monday.

I wanted to let you know about the creation of a new Defense Department Office for Rule of Law and International Humanitarian Policy. This office will be the focal point for OSD activities relating to democratic accountability, rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian policy, and will work with other DoD components, interagency partners, Congress and non-governmental actors to identify new initiatives in these areas.

This is a ""first"" for DoD, and I hope that this office, which I'll be heading up, will become an enduring symbol of President Obama and Secretary Gates' commitment to core norms of international humanitarian law, human rights and democratic accountability. These core norms are important in their own right, and also essential to our success in missions ranging from counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism to humanitarian assistance and stability operations.

This new office was announced within OSD Policy last week, but it will likely take us a few months to get fully staffed up and sort out various remaining details. As a result, we anticipate a gradual start-up; we'll be taking on projects and issues as resources permit. For the next couple of months, we will be mostly in the planning stage, and I'd very much welcome your suggestions (both now and once the office is fully up and running).

I will also remain dual-hatted as Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USDP), and in that capacity will continue to lead Policy's Global Strategic Engagement Team (GSET).

The key point to make to these guys tomorrow is the following:

• Around the world, we see countries gaining power and influence not because of the strength of their militaries, but because of the growth of their economies. Meanwhile, closer to home, the American people are hungry for jobs and recovery. We recognize that America's leadership and our economic strength are a package deal—and we are taking steps to shore up both.

• That is why we are putting ""economic statecraft"" at the heart of our foreign policy agenda. Economic statecraft has two parts: first, how we harness the tools and forces of global economics to strengthen our diplomacy; and second, how we are putting our diplomacy to work to strengthen our economy.

Ultimately, diplomacy and economics are a reinforcing cycle — our diplomacy can help spur economic growth at home (while of course recognizing that the work we have to do domestically, in infrastructure, entitlement reform, etc. is by far the most important thing), which in turn strengthens our economy, which in turn strengthens our diplomatic hand overseas in a world in which economic influence is a primary point of leverage and leadership, and so on.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

Recall that the plan received approval by a municipal sub committee in late June.

Lots of other details here that Jerusalem will be including in a front channel cable. Amanda Pilz, CCed here, drafted.

Bottom line though is that (1) this is on the agenda at the explicit direction of the Mayor and deputy mayor and (2) there is no statutory or other need for this review tomorrow.

Also note that this is not the final step in the process. After full Jerusalem municipal approval the plan must go to Ministry of Interior bodies. So there is a whole lot of theater involved in this.

Lastly, recall that the Gan Hamelech plan involves extensive demolitions and the redevelopment of Bustan, a section of the Silwan which is a stone throw away from the Old City. (When S made her comments on demolition in November 2009 she was referring to Bustan demolitions)

On the assumption that S would like a bit of background on the US economy from time to time, I am sending this along. It pretty well summarizes the current state of affairs-- and why the jobs situation is so weak.

The United States had another month of disappointing job growth in April, the Labor Department said Friday. The nation's employers added 115,000 positions on net, after adding 154,000 in March. April's job growth was less than what economists had been predicting. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.1 percent in April, from 8.2 percent, partly because workers dropped out of the labor force.

Government job losses totaling 15,000 continued to weigh on the economy, tugging down job growth as state and local governments grapple with strained budgets. Private companies added 130,000 jobs, with professional and business services, retail trade, and health care doing the most hiring. Such job growth is not nearly fast enough to recover the losses from the Great Recession and its aftermath.

I just met with a couple of women from Libya who are part of a new ngo (they are all new), ""Women for Libya"". We are going to get together with a larger group in the next few weeks but I wanted to tell you a couple of points they made since I know you'll be speaking tom'w. First, Libya is a place where the US and our allies have credibility and suasion, so what we say matters. Secondly, there is only one woman in the NTC and that kind of symbolism is not sufficient if Libya's transition to a better future is going to become a reality. It is not only not going to be acceptable to the international community to marginalize the women but it should not be acceptable to Libyans to exclude half their population, many of whom were significantly engaged in supporting the uprising. The women are eager to take their place. They came in today --the way the Northern Irish did with you so many years ago-- and pleaded for support to build women's leadership capacity and to be embraced as part of a larger network.

If there is any chance I-IRC could fit an Oxford stop into her itinerary, Skoll would jump through hoops to bring together an audience that would be high value for her/State objectives. HRC expressed interest in 2009 in speaking at this Forum. She has a standing invitation, but it did not work out to accept in either 2010-or 2011. A glance at the cast of social entrepreneurs supported by Skoll underscores the relevance to current urgent needs for innovation and partnership in advancing access to economic opportunity and peace globally. The leaders Skoll convenes in Oxford span the globe and their work is both effective and moving to scale. This would be a great venue to advance the impact investment and Middle East peace messages, among others.

I hope all is well personally. It's a torrid political situation for the Administration. Progressives are not in a good position on debts and deficits anywhere; or not in a good political position, as we have some good arguments.

I have been doing some writing and speaking about ten years since 9/11. Perhaps one of your staff can get a piece I wrote for London based Prospect magazine just published, entitled ""Decade of Disorder"".

Further to our last conversation, in the Autumn I am taking up the cause of youth unemployment, and will be chairing a short (hopefully sweet) blue-ribbon panel on the lost promise to young workers. But there is very little space in formal UK politics; parties can't have two leaders.

I have a couple of big decisions to take and it would be good if we could catch up when I am in DC 26-28 September (I am contributing to a Post conference on China at which I think your husband is interviewing Henry Kissinger). I will ask my office to contact yours but perhaps you could register the dates with your team.

Hope you get a break. Despite Assad and other problems I still think Arab Spring will work out. I am very concerned about Af-Pak and MEPP as they two great insolubles. As for EU it is not an advert for anything at the moment. The bond markets are capricious and unaccountable but they do capture truths about political uncertainty.

We would have to work it hard with relevant folks here and in Israel.

If we are unable to change the language, on balance I would veto. If we abstain on a resolution that is contrary to our position, after we have suggested we would veto, it will appear that we are acting in reaction to the situation on the ground. I think that would make us appear weak rather than strong. It is hard to articulate a rationale for abstention that does not suggest that this is a retreat in response to events.

Dear Madam Secretary,

Faith and I are now well settled in Baku. Given the terrible events of the past few weeks, I wanted to bring to your attention a heartening anecdote, which shows that most people in this part of the world feel positively about America. Faith and I visited the city of Lankeran this past weekend. Lankeran is located about 20 miles from the Iranian border and is religiously more conservative than the rest of the country. We went there because Azerbaijan is hosting the Under 17 Women's World Cup, and the opening game between the United States and France, was held there in a filled 12000 seat stadium. We are using this tournament to emphasize the importance of young women in sports and the importance of team sports to later life. During the game we walked around the track surrounding the field to a group of Azerbaijani girls, who had been invited by a local Peace Corps volunteer and who were all decked out in American regalia. They were quite excited to meet us. But what was more amazing was that walking back as we passed by each section, the entire crowd cheered loudly. Faith was like ""Mother America"" waving to the crowd! She is the one who should be Ambassador! We were very heartened. It is easy to get a little bit discouraged when things go badly in a lot of countries, but little things such as this experience reminded us that a lot of people still look to America. The game itself was hard fought and ended in a 0-0 tie. The U.S. still has a good chance to win it all.

• We are also here with a simple message with respect to the elections: the voices of the people of Haiti must be heard. The votes of the people of Haiti must be counted fairly. And the outcome of this process must reflect the true will of the Haitian people. That is the only interest of the United States. We will stand in solidarity with all those pursuing these goals, and we will stand against those who seek to undermine them.

First, I heard that she said that the Central Bank in Goma had been looted and that all the gold had been removed. I double-checked with post and we understand that M23 attempted to rob the bank, but that MONUSCO (which is conducting 84 daily patrols in Goma) intervened and was able to recover everything that M23 started to take out. (They did this without a fight.) At this time, the bank is not missing anything.

Second, I heard that she said that M23 had blocked the roads and no food was getting into Goma. It is true that M23 controls the roads and the airport, but there is food inside the city and humanitarian actors are able to travel into and out of Goma. Humanitarian aid delivery continues despite the airport's closure, as supplies continue to arrive in Goma via truck and from the Goma/Gisenyi, Rwanda and border. Humanitarian staff in Goma have been able to reach over 110,000 people in each of the last two days with water and sanitation materials; and WFP's food distributions have been largely uninterrupted for the more than one million people in North Kivu who are food-insecure.

Don't miss the story in The Hill ""Issa closes in on Clinton"" about Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) aiming at his biggest target yet, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The story is correct. The Issa strategy will backfire. It will prove to be a disaster.

There is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan witch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing days of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe has gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many voters.

I am sending this on behalf of Eric, who is heavily engaged with the Global Fund today. We wanted to give you a heads up on new data that NIH will be releasing today, which shows a strong HIV prevention benefit resulting from antiretroviral treatment.

The study, HPTN 052, is a rigorous randomized control trial of 1763 HIV discordant couples (97% heterosexual). In half of the couples, the HIV+ partner was started on ARVs with a CD4 count between 350 - 550, the ' early treatment group' ; the remaining couples had a delayed start of ARVs (HIV+ partner CD4 < 250 cells, or symptomatic).

In the early treatment group, there was only 1 new HIV infection among 882 couples. There were 27 new infections among HIV negative partners in the delayed treatment group. The Data Safety Monitoring Board has stopped the study early and discontinued the delayed treatment arm, given the significance of these results.

This study will have significant implications for HIV prevention where the epidemic is driven by heterosexual transmission. Five PEPFAR countries were involved as trial sites (Botswana, South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, Zimbabwe). We will follow up with an information memo to you and a briefing for Lois and Dana.

It's an important initiative and we'd like to heighten awareness of State's contributions in this area in the hopes of maintaining support for it in the future.

"C05762730_3","","Dear John, Thank you for responding to me re:the safety of the EP. Unfortunately, the 60 minutes interview has been raising jingoistic fervor in Turkey. As I told you, the Foreign Ministry called HAH on Friday to express their dismay and concern that He was disparaging Turkey in such a public manner. Of course, HAH expressed His love for His country, Turkey, but reiterated the painful, laundry list of issues faced by the Greek Orthodox Christian minority. Today, many of the news outlets in Turkey are attacking HAH saying that He has condemned Turkey's good name. One of the nationalist papers called HAH crazy and pictured Him hanging from a cross. (see attachment) The Foreign Ministries said, acourse, that he was sure the EP made ""a slip of the tongue."" Our concern is that some nationalists will attempt to do damage to the Patriarchate or, ever worse some nut from the Grey wolves will be let loose to hurt/kill HAH. Of course, the Government may over react once they see the full interview. It is an honest piece of journalism - but very very tough ""to face the country in the mirror"". Sadly, some Greek Nationalists fan the flames from their side as well. I am also sending you a blog<http://www.cbsnews.com/8618-18560_1625990771.html?assetTypeld=58&messageld=8825797>which shows some of the the lunacy out there on this issue.

Our key Thursday night dinner/Friday morning interlocutor, whom we met yesterday, asked to see Rangoon DCM today (Tuesday) as a follow up. She expressed concern that hardliners, led by Than Shwe, are signaling to NPT that authorities are moving too quickly in including her and her party in the political process. She says that delay tactics (like possibly postponing by-elections until March or beyond) may be designed to incorporate steps that exclude rather than include.

She expressed no reservations with our planned moves/announcements, previewed and discussed yesterday, but did ask that we not limit our asks to political prisoners. She said it would be helpful for S to convey that we will ""not make any big steps"" until the authorities a) release political prisoners; b) hold free, fair by-elections, and c) ensure that her party is a part of the process.

Comment: Not sure why she didn't convery this yesterday, but apparently after sleeping on it overnight she concluded that the hardliners are on the job, and that the visit is an important opportunity to thwart their specific tactics.

On the work front, if it is of interest, I would be glad to share with you my current thoughts on European economic and financial challenges; and a brief update on what we have been doing over at the CFTC with regards to financial reform as well as what we have been doing to coordinate reforms internationally.

In a nutshell, on. Europe, though Mario Draghi and the ECB have relieved considerable pressure from the banking and financial sector by injecting 1 Trillion Euros of 3 year loans into the European banking sector and Greece has recently restructured its debt, I remain concerned about the long term viability of the monetary union. The steps forward in the direction of more centralized fiscal discipline, in my opinion, still do not address the fundamental challenges of comparative competitive capabilities across a common currency union. Given the realities of politics, culture and language, the free flow of labor and fiscal transfers are not likely to be significant enough to relieve the pressures that have already built within the Euro zone and surely will be exacerbated over time from different growth rates across Europe. As a point of reference, when East and West Germany were unified and adopted a common currency, it took

To be grateful for each day and make a difference."" He then said that he hoped to live to see the day when countries came together and make consistently good decisions.

Great to hear from you. To be honest, I would ask Ryan Rowlands and Anne Marie Moore (PAO and CAO Belgrade), since I heard about the visit from them. Marion may have been one of those visitors he knew about through other contacts (as in, not through Sports United), and when they offered it to us, we said yes immediately. Belgrade friends — can you provide Nicole the background on Marion's visit?

We would still love to have more sports exchanges, especially since it remains one of the tools that works so well here. It would not be duplicating efforts; this visit by Marion is focused on the Rule-of-law message (don't dope, respect institutions), but I know other Sports Programs could really resonate with the Reconciliation message — and that's what we would like the most. So please do keep Zagreb in mind, and we are developing our strategy for Sports diplomacy. We will be in touch in 2 weeks with those ideas.

The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of the Honduran people.

Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care reform.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.

I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.

Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.

As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects.

We are also developing a strategy to push out the ""positive"" stories about all we are doing.

As a first step in the process, yesterday we directed all posts to push a response to the Uganda bombing focusing on the attacks, less from a US perspective, and more on the attacks on innocent soccer fans celebrating Africa's shining moment as host of the World Cup. As part of that approach, one person from AF/PD suggested reaching out to FIFA to get them to issue a statement condemning the attacks.

A key factor in our ability to do all this will be to ensure that we have the right people in the right places. This is no easy task in a system which rewards longevity over performance.

Prime Minister Papandreou stuck to the usual script in his annual speech in Thessaloniki over the weekend, but announced no new measures. Venizelos, however, announced a new property tax levy (to be collected via electricity bills) in a desperate effort to raise more revenue. There is widespread backlash against this latest tax increase. Even those who have supported the government up until now believe that this is the wrong way to go and that the PASOK government is refusing to do what really needs to be done which is to slash public expenditures by eliminating positions or furloughing unneeded employees, and to get serious about collecting taxes from those who still do not pay.

Against this backdrop, we continue to hear more and more rumors of either early elections or some sort of ""grand coalition"" government. The problem is, of course, that early elections will not likely resolve anything. New Democracy leader Samaras has not changed his critical tone and continues to insist that somehow he would be in a better position to ""negotiate"" with the Troika. While New Democracy did join forces with the government last month in passing much-needed educational reform, they have not shown any inclination to help the government on much tougher measures to streamline the bureaucracy and trim public expenditures. In their defense, however, the ruling party itself remains intensely divided on this score, which is doubtless why the government keeps going back to the same well when it comes to short-term taxes or revenue ""fixes.""

What more can I say? Most Greeks are back from their August vacations, strikes are again a daily occurrence, and more labor and social unrest seems likely. The weather, however, is terrific. I will keep you posted. All the best, Dan","3","3","2","3","2","2","3","2","2","2"

We have had two long days of negotiations here. Not much progress on major purchases (boeings etc). Some on indigenous innovation and intellectual property protection.

But now there is recognition at senior levels about how disappointed we are that more progress on commercial/economic issues has not been made and we believe, leaders are working to encourage their team to put together a bigger/better package.

I raised with Foreign Min the company issue you mentioned to him after your lunch -- and his staff is looking into it. They have all the background.

I am flying back tomorrow. Will send more detailed email report after we have a final meeting with the ambassador tomorrow am.

I had a good conversation with Amb Jeffrey and he wants me to start immediately. I told him that I was ready to take on this enormous challenge but first needed to talk with you on timing, the reporting chain and staff, plus transition on FtF front (most important to me). On staffing, he wants S to persuade SecDef to appoint a 3-Star counterpoint for the coordinator to work with on OSD side. He is looking at the model that was used to set up the first Iraq office in Washington under Ambassador Ricciardone, Bob Godec, Jeannine Jackson etc. back in 2002/03. I was working on Afghanistan then and had some interaction with the setup team. He could not recall if the team was part of NEA or part of P back then.

He envisions that the ""coordinator"" will have three jobs related to the transition: be the communication link between all the inter-agency players in DC and in Iraq, especially keeping the Embassy looped in; push the bureaucracy to carry out commitments, especially the military; encourage creativity and flexibility on all fronts dealing with this transition. There are five pieces: OSCI, police/justice training, USG presence, intel sharing/force protection and highend services (medical, medivac, Logcap etc.)

He mentioned that there will be a large transition conference next Friday. Amb Jeffrey, General Austin, Deputy Secretary Nides and Pat Kennedy will all be attending. He recommended that I attend as well.

I am available to discuss this all with you in person or over the phone today, this weekend or next week. I am headed to USAID this afternoon for Liberia's strategic review but can be reached on my blackberry

"C05739697_1","","Jake,

The Secretary asked me this afternoon about timing for a call/meeting with Hb1 on the Syrian opposition. I told her wanted to consult with Robert to double check on this:

Robert agrees that 1-1131 remains quite involved in the Syria issue. For instance, when he was in the London meeting on the Syria opposition just before UNGA, the Qatari rep got Hill on the phone in minutes during the meeting to weigh in on a Q re the SNC — and HbJ's view carried the day.

We are now sending to Amb Susan Ziadeh the list of organizations that we want to Qataris to contact inside Syria to ask them to choose reps to send to Doha. We are also sending her the list of names we are socializing for consideration for the 'political council"" Susan can discuss these lists in Doha on Sunday, so it would make sense for S to wait until Monday or Tuesday to engage with HbJ on some of these ideas for managing the conference and its outcomes.

Robert confirms that there is a lot of talk about the Doha meeting being postponed for a few days, but there is no new firm date. We are quite comfortable with a delay as it gives us (and others) time to press for good representation/participation and a better outcome. The idea of a follow-on conference in Cairo is still very much alive.

She suggested she might also check with Hb1 on whether he is planning a trip here anytime soon. Meeting him in person would be great if he's planning a trip here.

II send a note up on Monday with some ideas on the Libya meeting that the Secretary asked about.

"C05771374_0","Monterrey Consulate","Please pass to the Secretary

Madame Secretary,

I wanted to follow-up with you on my earlier note about the security situation in Monterrey. We have been working very closely with Pat Kennedy to assess all of our options. Pat has shown tremendous flexibility and has provided excellent counsel.

As we looked further into the Aug 20 shooting incident at the American School, it became clear that there many competing versions about the causes behind the incident. We decided that it is best to leave this matter to local law enforcement officials and to concentrate our review on whether it is possible to provide adequate security for the children of U.S. personnel in Monterrey.

Our discussions with police and other security officials made clear that local police and private patrols do not have the capacity to deter gangs and cartels from areas around the schools attended by the children of U.S. personnel. Local authorities, we found, are not able to respond in a predictable and effective manner to calls for assistance. Given the increasing level of violence that is occurring all over Monterrey, including near where our children go to school, we determined that the only immediate, practical, and reliable way to reduce the security risks for all children is to relocate them to the United States.

We are working with Pat Kennedy on the appropriate mechanism to formalize these arrangements. I have also advised Secretary Espinosa and Nuevo Leon Governor Medina that we are moving in this direction. In parallel with this, I recommitted to our Mexican counterparts that we will continue to do everything possible to support their efforts to improve the security environment in Monterrey and other parts of the country.

Thank you for your support on this matter.

Meanwhile, chatter at the State Department is about the likely move of career Foreign Service officer Victoria Nuland, former ambassador to NATO and now special envoy for conventional forces in Europe, to be the department's spokeswoman.

The expected move was first reported Monday by our pal Laura Rozen at Yahoo News — though it's been in the works for a couple of months. The possibility has raised a few eyebrows in town because Nuland, who's married to political scientist and Washington Post columnist Robert Kagan , was principal national security adviser to Dick Cheney starting right after the invasion of Iraq, from July 2003 to July 2005. (Of course, we recall that Hillary Clinton was a backer of that war.)

On the other hand, during the Bill Clinton administration, Nuland was chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, a longtime Clinton pal.

Given Nuland's foreign policy chops, one would assume she will have ready, direct access to Secretary of State Clinton, which of late has not always been the case with spokespersons. Another question is whether Nuland will be the traveling spokesperson when Clinton goes overseas. That role has often been taken by longtime Clinton aide and former Senate press secretary Philippe Reines, who has also been the one sitting in when Clinton is interviewed by reporters.

Mike Hammer, now acting assistant secretary for public affairs, is still expected to be nominated to take that job on a permanent basis.","3","2","3","3","1","2","3","1","3","2"

"C05775835_0","","Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing to express my strong support for full funding of the President's FY 2011 foreign affairs budget request (the 150 account) which, along with defense, is a critical component of an integrated and effective national security program.

I understand this year presents a challenging budget environment, with competing domestic and international pressures. However, I strongly believe a robust civilian foreign affairs capability, coupled with a strong defense capability, is essential to preserving U.S. national security interests around the world.

State and USAID partners are critical to success in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Ow military and civilian missions are integrated, and we depend upon our civilian counterparts to help stabilize and rebuild after the fight. As U.S. forces transition out of war zones, the U.S. goverment needs our civilian agencies to be able to assume critical functions. This allows us, for example, to draw down U.S. forces in Iraq responsibly while ensuring hard-fought gain% are secured. Cuts to the 150 account will almost certainly impact our efforts in these critical frontline states.

in other parts of the world, the work performed by diplomatic and development professionals helps build the foundation for more stable, democratic and prosperous societies. These are places where the potential for conflict can be minimized, if not completely avoided, by State and USAID programs — thereby towering the likely need for deployment of U.S. military assets.","2","3","2","3","2","2","2","1","2","1"

--Carlos did tell the Senator that the Brazilian family had floated the idea of allowing the son to spend Christmas with his father in Brazil. (I told Carlos that Hanukkah would have been quicker and more appropriate.)

Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst.

In my meeting yesterday with FM Smith, he said he'd still like to speak with S. Originally, they were scheduled to talk last Friday but it was cancelled. Given the change in leadership, and Smith's increased responsibility -taking on trade and aid portfolios as well as foreign affairs -- I think a brief call would be helpful.

Also, I spoke at length with former PM Rudd on Monday. Although he did not raise the issue, his aide called Edgard afterward and noted that Rudd had not heard from S, and would have hoped for a sympathetic call. I have no strong point of view on this one. He has received such a call from POTUS already.

Fear of Chinese retribution (economy. Iran, etc) can't be allowed to paralyze reassessment, though it should be factored into scenarios. The Europeans are being damaged worse by Chinese economic policy than us and China policy is a new area for the Western alliance to consult on.

I realize that considerable behind-the-scenes work goes into a speech like this. While civil society has an important role in critiquing governmental actions, I also think that it's important to recognize the efforts of our remarkable colleagues in government.

Please also know that you can count on ICNL to redouble its efforts - within the CD Working Group and otherwise - to advance the objectives set forth in Krakow.

Been in touch with ADMs Stavridis and Locklear.

Relatedly, FR and UK are pushing the idea of sending a Nato liaison to the TNC to work the PA angle as well as to provide a way to improve communications between INC and Nato HQ on the bigger picture. Sounds sensible, the we need to avoid sense that Nato is recognizing TNC or wants role in any political process. Would welcome your thoughts on this.

"C05794842_0","","Possible legislative responses to strip search decision

As we discussed, this week, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the use of visual strip searches (without physical contact) for every individual who enters the general population of a detention facility. Under this rule, the Fourth Amendment does not require reasonable suspicion that the detainee is hiding contraband, or that the detainee is alleged to have committed more than a minor offense, before prison or jail officials conduct such a search. The Department of Justice had filed an amicus brief supporting this result.

As noted by the Chief Justice and Justice Alito, the Court left open the possibility of exceptions, such as where the detainee is to be segregated from the general population. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, however, appears to rule out a test based on the seriousness of the offense. Justice Breyer, in his four-justice dissent, would have held that a strip search of an individual arrested for a minor offense that does not involve drugs or violence is ""unreasonable"" unless supported by reasonable suspicion. Critics of the Court's opinion have argued that it embraces a ""police-state logic"" that seeks to eliminate any and all security risks, without balancing that goal against other values such as privacy, liberty, and anti-discrimination.","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","2"

I've attached Admiral Mullen's 2011 guidance that just came out today. He makes a direct reference to supporting implementation of the QDDR (in conflict prevention and response) on p. 6 at the bottom in the Conclusion. Just this line alone will result in a trickle down effect that will lead DoD and the military to look for our leadership and a more formal mechanism to support us in this area. Our implementation planning on conflict prevention and response would benefit from a very active effort and a more formal initiative to harness DoD. The final report makes room for this by making CSO a center for civil-military collaboration on conflict - but it does not say much more than that. So the details will need to be worked out in implementation planning.

I've had two people from DoD send me this document today asking what our plans are and looking for some direction on next steps :)

They discussed the genesis of the CSCC, how it fits into the interagency process, and some ongoing projects. There were no surprises, and no detailed questions about budget, staffing pattern or other quotidian matters. Instead, the conversation focused on strategy and tactics.

Paul, whom I've known for a few years, is a straight-shooter and a strong PD supporter. More than once during the meeting he indicated how glad he is that the CSCC is a reality, and that he remembers well the testimony that Judith gave to his committee that included plans for CVE.

We most recently saw each other downtown at the Meridien Hotel.

State just announced the long anticipated appointment of Johnnie Cash as Assistant Secretary of State for Africa - a very good man by all accounts. I have expressed interest in being one of his three deputies concentrating on financial markets where I have a great depth of experience and knowledge. It won't be easy persuading people to keep their markets open and private, having made such a mess of our own financial sector, but it is central to our long-term security and development interests. More broadly, if the State Department is seeking an expanded role in dealing with global economic issues, then my combination of business and government experience in Africa might be appropriate somewhere in the Undersecretary for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs. In USAID there is a position where my experience and skills could be helpful: Assistant Administrator — Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade.

I was contacted last week by the administration for a position at EXIM Bank, but I am not the right person for export financing for Boeing et al. I promoted the idea of shifting or emphasizing EXIM's focus to infrastructure/project finance where the huge gap in emerging—frontier markets has only widened. I offered to help Fred Hochberg (seemed a nice man — apparently worked in Clinton administration at SBIC) recruit someone and he kindly went back to Obama folks suggesting OPIC is a better spot for me, but an opportunity to work at State for the Secretary would be my first choice.","2","3","3","3","3","1","2","1","2","1"

FYI — I have just returned from a meeting at DOI. This was a scheduled meeting with Tom Strickland (A/S for Fish/Wildlife and National Park Service) to discuss our efforts on many topics — e.g. CITES, Biodiversity, etc. Tom brought Sec. Salazar in to meet us and discuss a few topics. There are two issues you should know about:

1) Arctic — Sec Salazar plans to join S in Canada next week at the Arctic-5 meeting. (He is still very interested in engaging in the Arctic and does not seem to be a big fan of the Arctic Council — suggesting it is too low level. ) Regarding the meeting in Canada, we are looking for a role for Sec Salazar and think the best issue for him might be the outer continental shelf. We are going to check into this based on the current meeting agenda.

2) Sec Salazar is interested in pursuing a ""peace park"" linking Big Ben National Park in Texas to land in Mexico. From our discussion it seems that the land in Mexico is not yet owned by the government. Sec Salazar indicated that he has had discussions with the NSC about this, specifically in terms of President Calderon's visit in May and the state dinner. He suggested that this would be a subject of discussion during the visit. He is already planning meetings with DHS on this topic. (We are tracking down more details on the potential park.)

I am passing this on to you as Sec Salazar mentioned that he would be discussing the park and the upcoming Arctic meeting with S soon.

Wanted to give you a heads up on this in case calls S. The WH announced their intent to nominate Sim Farar and Ryan Crocker to the Public Diplomacy Advisory Commission in November However, the WH has NOT yet nominated them, citing concerns that the Committee has not been reauthorized.

My understanding from speaking with R and H (though waiting on final confirmation from Pat Kennedy) is that although the authorization for the Committee expired on October 1, 2010, because the Committee was re-funded by Congress under the CR, it was ""by de-facto"" re-authorized until March 4th. If no funding is authorized in a 2nd CR or omnibus budget or the Committee itself is not re-authorized by Congress by March 4th, then the Committee's activities must cease on that date.

H called Sen. Kerry and Sen. Lugar's offices, both who said they are fine with the nominations going forward even though the authorization has not been sorted out, understanding the importance of public diplomacy initiatives to this administration. I relayed this to PPO, but they still are holding.

While the general consensus appears to be that it will likely be re-funded, Sen. Boxer's office (who was supportive of in this role) is saying chances are only 50/50 and others have mentioned that Sen. Coburn may block it.

I will keep you posted on this, but wanted to get it on your radar in case he calls S about it as well. Many thanks. Heather","2","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","3"

"C05789259_1","","Dear Secretary Clinton,

Happy Memorial Day! So many veterans must be thrilled to celebrate the holiday knowing that OBL is no longer hatching plots.

I thought the speech was impressive. The beginning — where he thanked you for your tireless efforts -- was a high point, and he deserves credit for identifying the United States as being on the right side of history in a region where so many autocrats are on the wrong side of it. The section with the line about the obsolescence of ""strategies of repression and strategies of diversion"" was powerful.

Beyond what could be addressed on that occasion, I can't help being wary of the fact that the region remains a place where states are interpenetrated and outside powers have consistently intervened. Turkey is in a very interesting position vis-a-vis Syria, even as Iran and Saudi Arabia compete for influence there; I would not be surprised ifChina were working behind the scenes both to shore up Qaddafi and to cultivate good ties with a range of possible successors; etc. Given these dynamics, in a future address, it might be appropriate to go into further detail in laying out our principles for resolving regional rivalries and disputes -- like you did in the South China Sea context. I also can't help thinking about how the Middle East might look if Iraq realizes its potential as a major energy producer.

Thank you again! All best, Jackie

The Constitution states that ""the citizens of Afghanistan--whether man or woman--have equal rights and duties before the law"" and includes special provisions (article 44 requires the state to create and foster balanced education for women; article 53 stipulates that the state must render aid to women without caretakers; and articles 83 and 84 provide quotas for women's participation in the upper and lower house respective) to encourage women's access to education and government.

It explicitly notes that the state to abide by the UN charter, international treaties, international conventions that Afghanistan has signed (Afghanistan has also ratified CEDAW which prohibits discrimination in public and private realms) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

However, article 3-- which stipulates that no law ""shall contravene the tenets and provisions of the holy religion of Islam"" --leaves the rights accorded to women ambiguous and up for interpretation The power of interpretation is left up to the Supreme Court, whose members often have a conservative religious training.

As witnessed in the debate over the Shiite Family Law, there is now a significant women's movement in Afghanistan which is prepared to challenge any effort to curtail women's rights. However, they continue to rely heavily on the international community to promote and protect women's rights and to create a space for their advocacy.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"
"C05760124_0","","Tom and Craig--

I spoke w Secretary Solis and thanked her for going to Honduras. She is eager for your briefing and advice when you meet w her today. And it is very important that Craig is going w her to guide her thru this process.

Oscar Arias told me he is very worried about whether the agreement will be implemented and is meeting w the leading Presidential candidate this week to urge that he produce his party's 55 votes for restitution.

I also spoke w Insulza who is focussed on the elections which I told him we would fully support. Is there more we should be doing?

Again, thanks for all your great work and good luck in the effort to get this across the finish line. Best, HRC","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","1","1"
"C05785246_1","","I am told this information is especially sensitive. Two points that can be drawn: 1. The commitment of Egyptian Special Forces to the overthrow of Qaddafi is rooted in more than longstanding Egyptian hostility to Qaddafi, but also the Egyptians' belief that their economic future may be greatly aided by the outcome in Libya and the relationship with post-Qaddafi Libya. 2. The personal name-calling by certain U.S. officials of Qaddafi is stiffening his resistance and he is using it internally to support his case with his followers that he is fighting Western/Israeli imperialism, foreign interests, etc., according to one of his advisers. This rhetoric differs from the formal condemnations of Qaddafi's abusive rule and policies by other senior officials and Western governments.","2","3","3","3","2","1","2","1","1","1"
"C05781942_0","Tara Sonenshine","I understand you are talking to her about the McHale job.

Without exaggeration, Tara is one of the most talented people I have ever worked with -- in government or out.

She is razor sharp, politically astute, with a great sense and understanding of communicating foreign policy effectively. She works incredibly hard. She will be completely loyal. She has the respect of the foreign policy community.

There is noone I would rather be in a foxhole with (and indeed have been more than once).

This is a perfect time in her life/career to take on this challenge.

I'd grab her.

Best, Sandy","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3"
