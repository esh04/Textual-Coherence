So I've recommended that we discuss with individual shippers what there needs might be as far as term, then give them a number.  They were planning on calling shippers individually anyway to make them aware of the Needles space.

"1144534","Master Netting Agreements Reminder","Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).

Or something like that.   Is there any problem with that?  Second, the Jeffs (Fawcett and Dasovich) and perhaps others will be talking to Danny shortly about a possible next phase expansion into California.  Someone please take point on passing info from that meeting on to Shelley and MKM and me.  Shelley may want to have Stan tell Madden that we are looking at an additonal large expansion beyond the one we are about to file.  The PR mileage might be useful but Shelley will need to know as much as we can disclose outside about what we are up to.  If we get serious about looking at something that goes beyond the Cal border we may want to hold that internally for a while and not tell Madden.  On the other hand, I don't have any problem with Stan telling Madden that we have general concerns about whether pipe expansions within California will keep pace with interstate expansions to the border.

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

"34113","Was thinking very hard on your 100,000 mile up summary from Friday","Understand that this was clearly a very high level generalization.  But with regard specifally to the risk management teams, my sense is that the London team tends to address things more from a theoretical, academic perspective (raising lots of questions and talking about what ""should be"") and that the Houston team tends to be more action-oriented in the here-and-now (thus my reference to practical).  I think that this probably stems from two factors:  (1) the bank, financial, more formalized risk training that the London staff has had, versus the energy company, more physical commodity oriented, on-the-fly, in-the-trenches type of indoctrination of the Houston team; and (2) the difference in the magnitude of the businesses and the degree of maturity of the Houston and London commodity markets (smaller business with a less rapid and volatile trading environment lends itself to a more reflective, studied approach and a larger, rapidly paced market place creates less time for study and more need for quick, practical solutions).  I think sometimes that the London risk team conveys a feeling of superiority over their Houston counterparts with regard to their risk analysis skill set, their ""theorectical"" approach.  And sometimes the Houston team just wants to know why those London guys can't organize their processes, vacation schedules and holiday staffing to get time deadlines met, ""practical"" solutions that the Houston team has down to a science.   I see a lot of talent on both sides of the Atlantic, and believe that both camps can learn both academic and practical lessons from one another.  I would like to work with you to continue to search for ways to encourage that knowledge exchange and to build a better appreciation for everyone's contributions.

"39309","The Houston Expl Dec 2000","Daren:

I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a Danny Conner deal from December 2000 that has a price issue.

We were buying gas from The Houston Exploration Company on Black Marlin, High Island 138/HPL meter 98663, deal 508426.  The deal was priced at HSC - 0.14.  In December, a new platform came on, High Island 115/HPL meter 986431.  It did not start flowing until the 20th.  Danny did not put a new deal in for this meter, so we combined the gas on deal 508426.  The Houston Exploration thinks that the gas at HI 115 should be kept separate and priced at HSC GD - 0.14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20th.  We agree that we received the gas.  We have the pipeline statement from Black Marlin.  We just don't have the same pricing.  The Houston Exploration shows that we owe them an additional $222k due to this price difference.  We only purchased this gas in Dec 2000 and Jan 2001.  The deal for Jan, 547063, was priced at GD - 0.14.  Can you verify how this deal should be priced?  I sent this issue to Danny back in January and he said the IF price was correct, but The Houston Exploration is sticking to their price.

I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.

Here is the Northern Border Pipeline draft stipulation that ENA is planning to present to the BTRC.

It also has backup disposition plans for ENA's Northern Border capacity in the event that the Enron Canada deals fall apart.  With respect to future claims, NBPL's posting of the capacity on their website is just another way to find creditworthy shippers that can step into ENA's shoes for the remaining terms of the firm max rate transport agreements.

"1268320","Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program","For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children.

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.","3","2","3","3","2","3","2","3","3","3"
"31040","Midwest protest filed at FERC","Enron filed a protest at FERC yesterday in the Midwest proceedings - both Alliance RTO and Midwest ISO as well as the National Grid filing pursuing the role of managing member of Alliance.  We asked the FERC to take immediate action giving specific guidance on the essential aspects of an RTO structure based on the SE mediation report by the ALJ (governance, stakeholder process and congestion management using LMP).  After such guidance we suggested that the order require a collaborative process of all parties to work out the details of an RTO to be fully operational by December 15, 2002.

Enron's request goes further than any of those recently filed at FERC by other parties which ask for the MW to be sent to mediation (much like the SE and NE proceedings).  Enron's pleading argues that the ARTO and MISO TOs and stakeholders already had a mediation-type process which resulted in a settlement.  Enron had been the only party to oppose the settlement on the basis that two MW RTOs would not work out the seams agreements sufficiently to make a single MW market.  The filings show in fact that the ""compatible"" protocols and procedures promised by the settlement have not succeeded in their attempts.  The amorphous agreements to agree by the two RTOs are still just that, lacking the detail necessary to assure a seamless MW market.

The FERC has indicated that it will issue a rehearing order in the Alliance RTO proceeding by November.  It is possible that they will also act on the above pleading in that order.","3","2","1","2","2","2","1","3","3","2"

"2761","Change of Control Provisions","As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","3","3"

EPMI has a WSPP Master Agreement with the Grant Public Utility District (""Grant ""PUD"").  Grant PUD terminated this agreement with EPMI on December 13, 2001.  All transactions were for physical power, and were documented and confirmed under the WSPP agreement.  Pursuant to a pre-petition agreement, at least two of the deals were converted to a cash payment and the physical delivery obligation was cancelled.

Grant calculated the termination payment as being $16,454,632.  On December 18, 2001, Grant paid this amount to Enron Account No. 40781075.

Tks for your effort. I did speak to Juan Hernandez yesterday. He gave us a quick view on SPP liquidity (or lack thereof). Based on this conversation, I prepared the attached document (for internal use only). Feel free to add or comment on it if you see fit.

Jim Steffes and I used this as ""ammunition"" in a hearing at Texas PUC to support the idea that SPP is not a perfect market, but we should not use its lack of liquidity as an argument for delaying retail competition in non-Ercot Texas. Unfortunately, Comissions were reluctant, and they preferred to postpone non-Ercot RTO retail competition until further notice. The milestone for ERCOT continues the same (Jan 01, 2001)

1.	What effect, if any, should be given to renewals of contracts originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commission's suspension of direct access?

An appropriate charge on direct access customers obviates the need to regulate renewals of direct access contracts entered into on or before September 20, 2001.  Absent the charge, the Commission would need to address what kind of renewals should be covered by any potential prohibition against renewals.  Prohibited renewals could include (1) renewal of contracts whose terms expire without any provisions for extension; and (2) renegotiation within the contract term of any material term or condition of the contract, including price.  The Commission would also need to consider whether an interim prohibition on renewals is needed to stop renegotiations or renewals that are very likely underway already, pending final Commission action.","3","3","2","3","1","2","3","3","2","2"

Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.

Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).

If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.

I reviewed the letter from Mr. S. Huey Long that you forwarded to me regarding his suggestion that you discuss with Mr. Ravi N. Tikoo the Dabhol situation and more specifically the Lakshmi LNG carrier and in return agree to let him bid on future LNG carrier chartering or financing business.  As you probably recall, we are a minority investor in the Lakshmi, with Mitsui OSK Lines the majority investor and operator of the vessel.  We are not really in a position to control decision making with respect tot he vessel and are currently maneuvering to get Mitsui to buy out our position.  Accordingly, I do not think there is anything productive to be gained from Mr. Tikoo with respect to the Lakshmi.  As to whether he can help more generally with respect to India, I defer to your judgement.  I think we are already well connected and engaging any additional intermediaries carries more risk in terms of confusion, mixed messages or inappropriate behavior from a FCPA perspective.

My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).

To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.

"744989","RTO Legal Question","I am working on an analysis of the details of the Barton draft RTO language.  While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it.  One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been ""approved"" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation.

If this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has ""approved"" PJM.  By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000.  They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the ""ISO principles"" of Order 888.

Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs.  If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to ""freeze"" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","1","2","2"
"1242206","Citizens Griffith","Received a call from Tom Tucker approximately 1600 wanting to switch the flow from TW to El Paso for testing purposes.  Tom explained that it was warranty work and the flow would only be switched for about 5-15 minutes. I agreed to allow him to switch the flow.  He agreed when he was finished testing that everything would be put back to the original set points and he would call GC when finished with the test.  Tom called GC shortly after the flow was put back to TW feed to Griffith.  He explained that it did not take long and everything was finished to his satisfaction.  Shortly afterwards at approximately 1725, I noticed that the TW feed to Griffith was falling in rate and El Paso went to 165 flow rate.  I resent the set point for TW flow to Griffith.  I called the Griffith plant and spoke to Dave (operator at the plant), who was unaware that Tom was in the yard, to check on the plant pressures and flow.  Dave had not seen any problems with pressures or flow.  I also called Tom's cell phone - reached him the second time.  He was still at the site and told me that he had by-passed our meter to Griffith.  He also told me that the reading from El Paso was false and apologized for not calling to let me know that he was performing additional work.  I asked him to call once again before leaving the site.","3","2","3","3","3","1","2","2","2","2"

"62555","Portland","I understand that the lease assignment needs to happen.  However, it is my understanding from talking directly to the landlord that they are modifying the lease to require us to pay for certain separatioon costs and upgrades to their facilities (e.g., security access to all of their floors in this building).  The landlord has also agreed, in concept, to provide us a six month option at the beginning of the term.

Based on discussions with you yesterday, it seemed that UBSW was not willing to insert any of the language that I wanted into the lease (e.g., six month option to get out), but was willing to insert language that the landlord wanted (obligating UBSW to several $100k of costs).  Why would UBSW do this?

I recommend that we either (1) make the landlord's changes and my changes this week or (2) make no changes this week and work to get the lease that both sides want next week.

Q:  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company?

A:  Not until closing, which may not occur for several months.  Until that time the law [antitrust law] requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have in the past.  In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc.  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.

"687334","SW flows","Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vacation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading company.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  This is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible thing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else with our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a tragedy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad for all those people who lost everything including a job.

"742845","ICC Meeting","The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO.  We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate.  The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result.  The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them.

We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market.  ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer.  This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC.

We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing.  A draft is attached.

"889867","Washington Gas Credit Policy","Molly - WGL's tariff allows them to demand collateral acceptable to them (cash, l/c, bonds) if we do not meet their credit qualifications (pp. 42-43 of MD tariff), which we don't.  The security requirement they have calculated (contained in Craig's earlier e-mail) of $1.0 million follows a process that is used for all gas marketers and was approved through the ""Gas Roundtable"" in MD, a cross-sectional group of industry players in MD.  In other words, the MD Commission would uphold this calculation.

I talked to Frank Donnelly, financing director, and Shelley Jennings, corporate treasurer, of WGL about the calculation.  Nearly all of the collateral is related to ""delivery risk"", which is 60 days of peak day usage, reduced by about 50%, priced at a forward NYMEX price.  This is not terribly unreasonable, and as I say, it would be acceptable to the MD PSC.

"1111635","Revised Trial Schedule in the CA Proceeding","This is a follow up to my September 19 e-mail.  The attached revised trial schedule was issued after the hearing held on Tuesday.  It reflects a recognition by the ISO of errors or omissions in its data relating to neutrality adjustments, resolved settlement disputes, penalties and OOM purchases.  It postpones the end of the proceeding until March 8, to provide time for correction of these deficiencies prior to undertaking the rest of the schedule.  Hearings on the various issues will be bifurcated- the hearing on Issue 1 (mitigated market clearing price) will be held 12/17-21, while the hearing on Issues 2 and 3 (amounts of refunds and offsets thereto) will be held on 2/11-15.  This outcome is good because Issues 2 and 3 were not split up, and additional hearing days were incorporated into the schedule.  The immediately upcoming events include an ISO sworn statement on Issue 1, due 10/9, and participants' simultaneous responsive testimony on Issue 1, due 11/6.

I would expect that the ISO will take approximately 3 weeks to re-run its numbers to correct their neutrality adjustment errors, and this will result in a new (and likely increased) claim against us.  Initially, ISO had claimed approximately $38MM from us, and their last erroneous iteration indicated that they owed us $1MM.

"749091","BORCO","I met with Jaime Vargas, President of BORCO and his staff including Matthew Missick, Maxwell Sweeting and Jan Olson on Monday morning regarding the proposed tank repair financing for storage payback. BORCO is highly motivated to do this deal and wants to supersize it ($10 million). Jaime's confidential comment to Jan ""was we need to do this deal."" Last Thursday, BORCO had their board meeting in Freeport and all of the PDVSA attendees approved the structure and concept of our deal. Jaime went on to say that PDVSA would look favorably on any term product purchase due to our new relationship with BORCO.   Obviously, the devil is in the monthly storage numbers and our willingness to commit, but we can get very cheap tankage relative to other Carib storage facilities. BORCO is going to revert with monthly fees for one and two turns on all of the following liquid fuels: crude, jet, diesel, gasoline and resid. They are also checking the premium to LIBOR they are willing to pay and if we can lower the interest rate premium they will in turn reduce the storage rate further.

Please give this storage opportunity some thought and I will soon schedule a video conference to discuss.","2","3","2","3","2","3","1","3","2","2"

We can certainly make a note in the corporate records that the date on the resignation letter is erroneous.  However, what happens on filings that have to be made with the registrars of companies in the various jurisdictions?  I'm not sure what the fallout is of making a filing that has contradictory supporting data.  I'm going to submit the letter to our service companies, explain what happened and see what they say.

"1354573","Doing what California does best---locking in a loss","Spokesman for California's Davis Sells His Shares of Calpine By David Ward  Sacramento, Aug. 2 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesman for California Governor Gray Davis, criticized for owning shares in power generator Calpine Corp., has sold the stock, the governor's office said.  Davis's interim communications director Steve Maviglio sold the 300 shares of Calpine that he had purchased last month, said Deputy Press Secretary Hilary McLean.  Republicans and public-interest groups criticized Maviglio for purchasing the stock while the Davis administration was negotiating long-term energy contracts with Calpine and promoting the company's efforts to build power plants in California.  ``He (Maviglio) felt it was becoming a distraction,'' McLean said.  Maviglio said that he had purchased 300 shares of Calpine at $40 each on June 20, after putting in an order on May 31. He denied any conflict of interest and said the stock was sold earlier this week.  Shares of San Jose, California-based Calpine rose 76 cents to $36.76 in midafternoon trading. They had dropped 9.7 percent from June 20 to yesterday's close.  Maviglio won't be fired or reprimanded for the purchase, McLean said. He won't comment on any conflict-of-interest issues before the administration, she said.  Republicans and public interest groups have criticized Davis after disclosures that some advisers and consultants to the state on energy matters owned shares in companies that are trading electricity or negotiating long-term power contracts with California.  California in January stepped in and began buying power for its two largest utilities, which are insolvent after running up more than $15 billion in debt because of a shortage of power plants and flaws in the state's deregulation law.","2","3","3","3","3","2","1","1","3","2"

Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday.  Next, we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the Adoption Agreement.  Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and Collateral Annex.  Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and any other Western related issues.

On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements (most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis.  These agreements will also require sign-off by legal and credit.  A discussion should be scheduled on Thursday or Friday.

Today's GD reports that the Colorado PUC is seeking public comments on policy changes necessary to provide price stability for customers.  The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice.

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.

I have to disagree with the ""they were available by phone.""  Being out of the office for ""Team Building"" on the last day of the month is inexcusable.  I tried calling Perry and there was no answer; he said he forgot and left his phone on vibrate.  The Omaha capacity people now carry text pagers that I can email info to; they have really improved their response.  The Houston staff needs these pagers too.  Capacity approval on TW is probably our weakest link in the process.  We really need your help to improve this or drastic action will be needed.  When I called at 3 pm to get a last second deal, I didn't get called back until 3:30 pm.  I was told they could be back in the office to approve the deal around 6 pm.  Well, even though I was here until 7 pm, Reliant wasn't going to be.  Perry said he could do it Saturday, once again, Reliant (or someone who can sign contracts) wasn't.  The TW Marketers, all of them, were also out of the office making EVERYTHING fall onto Contracts.  Why are we the only one's that need to be in the office?  I'm going to give this one more month and then, if everyone isn't working together on this, I'm going to Danny and tell him the Deal Capture team is off of TW since no one appears to give a rats ass (and this is after I've calmed down over the weekend).

I have completed a review our current requirements for services from EEOS as well as those for 2002. At present, we are using Bill Fox to support the coal initiative. In addition, we are using Ed Danhaus for City of Austin warranty work. All work by EEOS to support the site acquisition and development initiatives including Ft Pierce have been terminated or are being terminated. Matt Tezyk has just completed an inventory of the Westinghouse equipment (D5A) that we own that is currently in dispute. While we are not currently using EEOS for Vitro, Tractebel has a call on named EEOS personnel at the project budget through November of 02. We have an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to subsititute others if these individuals are not available. All these requirements as well as any others can be met from Virgo's group in 2002. Therefore, we have no requirements from EEOS in 2002.

Neither West Power nor Canada are currently using EEOS. The Longview project is in the pre-NTP phase.  A buyer could elect to use EEOS as the turnkey contractor but would not be obligated to use them nor would we be obligated to offer EEOS services in the sale. They do not anticipate using EEOS in 2002. Likewise, Canada will not use them in 2002.

Enron SA is currently using 1-2 engineers from EEOS on a full time basis. This requirement could increase (slightly) in 2002 if they phase out their inernal group. However they would also be comfortable using third party vendors in SA. Thus, they do not require EEOS.","2","1","2","1","2","3","3","2","1","2"

Nice to meet you over the ether, and I hope we will have a chance to meet when you are next in NY.  It certainly sounds like the Fortune 500 represent a large market with the characteristics you describe.  I would guess that they are somewhat harder to reach and sell than energy firms that are actively engaged in trading derivative products and do regard risk management as core, whether the system is run internally or accessed as a service.  I think the company will have to learn more about what it takes to sell to both customer segments as it gets started with its sales and marketing efforts, and I'm not sure any of us know enough about the market at this point to have a strongly held point of view.  I would certainly be interested in any information you have seen as to how the market will develop, and in particular what the breakdown of people trading with Enron as between Fortune 500 vs. energy industry players looks like.  Thanks for your thoughts, and this is clearly part of an ongoing dialogue with the company as to how to most effectively design, market and sell its products.

"725144","TransPecos Letter of Intent with Pemex","Rod,

I hear you.  However, what's changed since the last time you and I spoke about this project is that our friend Bill Wise has been talking with the Chairman of Pemex about doing a similar (180 mile) expansion of El Paso's system from Waha to Samalayuca.  His proposal was to provide incremental firm service to Pemex at EPNG's currently effective ""Texas"" rates (low 20 cent range).  Pemex management is willing to recommend to its Board of Directors going with a slightly higher rate on TransPecos in order to get the benefits of supply diversity and leverage, but the TransPecos rate needs to be as close to EPNG's as possible to make the case compelling.

Therefore, what we're trying to accomplish here is to give Pemex a rate representing effectively a rate cap, with an ""upside"" that if the FERC rate is less than the cap (which it might well be), then Pemex gets the lower rate.  It's just going to be damned difficult to hit a McGwire home run here with El Paso breathing down our neck.  I truly believe this is the best we can negotiate for fear of Pemex going back to their comfort zone with EPNG.

I have a slight disagreement with one statement, as follows: ""The Commission's reference to ""surcharge"" can be interpreted to mean both the one cent and three cent surcharges given that both surcharges were granted similar treatment in D.01-03-082.""  I don't agree that this is so black and white.  One can also take the interpretation that it was meant to apply only to the 3 cent and not to the 1 cent surcharge.  Obviously, SCE took the former interpretation and PG&E the latter.  That is one reason why we have been very careful about attacking this issue.   AReM has protested PG&E charging the one cent surcharge and supported Edison's approach in responding to the advice letters filed months ago.  AReM continues to work with the CPUC staff to get the staff to support AReM when it responds to the advice letters.  Be aware that there are strong forces working against ESPs and anything potentially favorable to them. The more we can accomplish this under the radar screen, the better off we will be.

During our meeting, Stewart and I discussed some concerns about BPA transmission such as load following service, 10-min dispatch for A/S, how BPA's decremental cost is calculated, control area reserves, and line losses.  He suggested we put together a list of transmission issues/requests for products that he could present to TBL on our behalf.  He said it would be more effective for us to give him a written document, as opposed to just having him relay our oral comments.

Please send me any suggestions you have for improving TBL's services.  If you will provide me with something to start with, I would be happy to polish it up and include it with the rest of our issues.

Obviously, TBL moves slowly so it is unlikely that any changes would happen immediately.  However, TBL has a one-year rate case every other year.  Next year is that year, so if we get our ideas in the hopper this year, we might see some of them in TBL's next rate proposal.

The problem is that those arguments - effectively that real competition will take away market power - are no longer effective at FERC.

Do we want Hirenymous (sp?) to undertake a proxy exam to see the real impact?

Restrictions:  Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.  It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  ""masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only"", ""no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions"", ""no oral trades allowed"", ""only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company"", ""all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures"".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.

We are not receiving timely information from the Hub regarding our Park and Lend Agreement.  I have not received an update since Tues or Wed of last week.   Mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been told that they don't have it, or it will be ready later.  Per GISB, final scheduled numbers on EPNG, NNG, and TW are reported at 9:00 am the following day (ie. Sunday final will be out at 9 AM on Mon.).  Prior to the transition from PG&E, we received our balance by 9:15 or 9:30 AM.  I realize that the transition has been difficult, they are never a cake walk, however, this type of information is crucial.  Further, they have not provided any final numbers for the month of April, we should at least be able to receive a ""best available"" number, and the Interstate Pipes, due to GISB, have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month.  I submit that ENA should not be held liable for payment of the $0.03/day rate, as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement.  If EPGT plans to administer fees, then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis.  We may want to check the terms of the agreement, and/or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of May.

"213923","Call to Bob Glynn","Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).

Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).","2","3","2","3","2","2","2","3","1","2"
"1134340","Value of ENE Stock under 1994 Deferral Plan","John:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!","3","3","3","3","1","1","3","2","3","2"

I called Tommy Edwards(713-209-1112) with Cima yesterday morning and talked with him about his plans for the new interconnect he has proposed.  They have completed 1 well and will drill up to 4 more development wells, in the near future.  The location he verified is Sec. 31, T19S, R21E, Eddy County, New Mexico.  He called us wanting an I/C, because the old map he was using indicated that Enron owned the lines.  The problem is that these were the gathering lines that we sold to Agave 5-6 years ago.  We still own the Atoka #1, 2 & 3 gathering compression units and the main branch lines,  but these wells will have to be connected to the Agaves Gathering system.

"1295112","Issuance of Letters of Credit","Jordan, in response to your questions concerning the issuance of letters of credit starting today, I think that the response needs to address two situations: the committed lc facilities [Chase and West LB] and the uncommitted facilities.

Since the uncommitted facilities involve minimal representations, they are not typically an issue [although we still need to review each circumstance individually], and unless there is a specific representation to Enron Corp.'s audited financials for the period 97-00 being prepared in accordance with GAAP, we should be able to issue letters of credit from an uncommitted facility.

However, sections 4.1(d) of each of  the West LB Facility and the Chase Facility contain a representation that Enron Corp.'s financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. This representation was false when made, and will always be false. Thus, there is an issue with an officer being able to make the representations and warranties necessary for an issuance of a letter of credit under one of these facilities [or for an extension of an existing letter of credit].

In order to utilize the committed facilities, it will be necessary to obtain an amendment or waiver of this representation, since simply adjusting the representation on an officer's certificate gives the agent a defense to issuance on the face of the certificate. [An amendment is preferable from Enron's perspective.] [Note that as we previously discussed, there is not an event of default under the facilities, since that provision has a materiality qualifier.]","2","2","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","2"

No - but they are probably a good candidate for the restructuring group.   They were originally 9 barges that were owned by CALME (D. Haug) and were being shopped around Enron for a home.   Some of them went to a power project in Nigeria and now their are two of them left without a home.

Last year they were being considered for a LIPA deal on Long Island that was orginally proposed by R. Maffett/R. Tapscott.  Janet D. was working on this deal before she left for EES - but I don't think she made any further progress.  As I recall the ownership of the barges came from the CALME organization into Mike McConnell's - EGM group as part of the split of CALME assets.

I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.

With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

"59784","California Update 4/12/01","Sources report that SoCal Chairman, John Bryson, and Governor Davis were roommates together at Stanford in the early 60's.  This longstanding relationship may provide some explanation for SoCal's willingness to negotiate with the governor and the governor's determination to reach a solution with SoCal.

Voluntary bankruptcy reportedly is ""not an option"" for SoCal.  However, the possibility remains that SoCal's creditors will take them into involuntary bankruptcy.  If the state's purchase of the transmission assets is delayed, it appears that the possibility of this occurring will increase.

However, the agreement by the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is actually a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement reportedly was rushed for ""political purposes,"" but the details still remain to be decided.  It is possible, the 60-day deadline stated in the memorandum may have to be extended.

PG&E reportedly refused to part with its transmission assets in its negotiations with the governor.  PG&E makes more money on transmission than distribution of power, the opposite is true for SoCal.","2","3","2","3","2","2","2","3","3","3"

Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6"" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in.

That largely involves firming up the position of the Liberal Party (currently in opposition but in a strong position to win in the next election) in support of moving forward with competition. The Liberal Party has asked me whether Enron (really someone like Rob Milnthorp or Paul Devries) might consider being the co-chair of a fund raising event for the party in November 2001. The event would be timed for the Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest annual energy conference in Canada) and would be targeted at people in the Ontario energy sector. Dalton McGuinty, the leader, would speak at the event.  I didn't dismiss the idea out of hand because it may have merit if : a)  through such an event, we can secure true bipartisan support for moving forward.  (In other words, if we were to do this, the material would have to state that Rob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the bipartisan support for the deregulation initiative and how such bipartisan support is good for the Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so would not alienate the governing Conservatives. (The Conservatives have always encouraged us to do what we can to keep the Liberals on side and I think they would be sophisticated enough to appreciate that efforts would involve participation in such fund raising events - particularly if the material used did not endorse the Liberals and merely recognized their support for moving forward).

As discussed before, you and M. Driscoll should plan on purchasing the remainder of EES base HLH and LLH needs next Tuesday (4/23). If May prices hold steady, Kim Nelson should expect to wire out another $10-$11 million on Tuesday (4/23). Just a reminder: please attempt to limit purchases from Avista.

"1250729","Bloomfield Inlet Air Cooler Project","Bill,

The following is a brief desciption of the above mentioned project.

The Bloomfield air inlet cooler project consist of the installation of evaporative pads around the existing air filters to reduce the ambient air temperature into units 1 & 2 turbines.  This will allow the turbines to run more efficiently and increase the amount of horsepower developed on hot summer days.  The evaporative system will not be operated on non-summer condition days.  The increase in horsepower will be about 350 Hp per unit which will not exceed the current air quality permit.  The permit limitation is in excess of 5800 Hp and the evaporative system will not increase the horespower no more than 5000 Hp on hot summer days.

If you need more information of clarification, please call.","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","3","2","3"
"3268","Business Practice #11","I have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response.

There are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term ""take away rights"", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a ""single bus"" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.

Each participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.

The ""single bus"" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.","2","1","2","1","1","3","2","2","2","2"

"59852","Review of disposed assets for residual value and/or potential exposure","Louise:  Attached is an Excel file which lists the results of our search for residual assets or old assets with potential exposure. Most of the assets on this list are currently being monitored by Special Assets or Energy Capital Resources.  We included these assets on the list because they have not been very visible and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of their existence.  However, also included on the list are 3 to 4 transactions similar to Midwest Gas Storage in that it appears that they have not been on anyone's radar screen.  The scope of our review did not include any former Enron International assets now managed by Wholesale through the Global Assets group.

Our list is divided into 3 parts:  1) Retained assets, 2) Bankruptcy/ Guarantor Claims,  3) Transactions requiring legal documentation/ closure.  The Bankruptcy/Guarantor list is not an all inclusive list of bankruptcies for Wholesale but includes those merchant portfolio bankruptcies with a  low probability of recovery which are, of course, not a high priority for Legal.  We just want to make sure they don't completely disappear from our scrutiny.  You will also note that there are a couple of assets that require further review and we will advise you when we make a final determination.

Finally, we will take steps to include these assets in future portfolio reporting so that they can be closely monitored.

Many thanks to Dick Lydecker's group and Legal for their assistance to RAC in reviewing numerous disposed assets that resulted in this list.   Please call if you have questions.    Regards!     Rick C.","2","3","3","3","1","3","3","3","3","3"

"751549","PEER GROUP MAPPING","Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.

On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.

I am planning to go.  I'm pretty sure Jane Tholt, who trades El Paso on the West gas desk, will go.  Suzanne Calcagno has also indicated an interest so she may go as well.

Jane's major concern at this time is that El Paso doesn't mess with the pooling procedures.  Their proposal calls for increasing the number of pools on the system from the current six to twenty, which the Desk feels would impair liquidity.

I wouldn't look for a lot of progress at this conference.  The EOC full-requirements customers are going to be howling about having their flexibility restricted in any way, and the other firm customers who have CD limits are going to howl about the full requirements customers having a secondary priority superior to theirs.  This same proposal was on the table and they couldn't reach a compromise in six months of settlement conferences working with the chief FERC ADR person on the Amoco/Burlington complaint case.  Our preference is with the CD customers' position, but if the full requirements customers don't get some kind of accommodation, they will never settle.

As you are aware, NBC has sent us notification of an event of default under the ISDA due to our failure to post collateral (in the form of an LC).  To date, NBC has resisted all of our commercial solutions to this issue.  At the close of business today, our cure period for the event of default will expire, and NBC will be able to draw on the $1.4MM LC posted and terminate the contract. Today we have seen a bit of movement in their position.  They are now willing to accept cash as collateral if Enron will agree to reduce its collateral threshold to some agreed upon amount.  Bill Bonnell, their credit manager, has suggested $4MM as the appropriate level. This would entail Enron posting $3MM in addition to the $500K collateral call for a total of $3.5MM.  I believe we could more than likely negotiate the threshold to $5MM if we are willing to post the cash.  A $5MM level would require an additional posting of $2MM which is what we originally forecasted to try to buy down the position exposure.  As we must have a resolution today to forestall further action on the part of NBC, please advise as to management's willingness to use cash for the purpose of preventing termination of this contract.

"59765","California Update - Urgent Please Read 5/7/01","Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote, lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission line purchase or other assistance.

There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X), Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.

The strongest possible buyer at this point would be VCP as they're currently in a very strong financial position (low leverage and are part of the Votorantim conglomerate which throws off considerable cash from its cement and financial services businessnes).  Also look for the Scandinavians to possibly make a bid for the assets as they've expressed interest in obtaining eucalyptus assets in the past.  We can most likely discount Aracruz from the running as they're currently rumored to be an acquisition target themselves (most likely buyer would again be VCP as they recently purchased Mondi's stake in the company and presently holds a 28% share in Aracruz --- however, it's doubtful that VCP would be able to swallow Cenibra and Aracruz simultaneously).  What does this mean for the market?  Any purchase by VCP would make them the strongest eucalyptus pulp producer globally with over 2 million tons (estimated market pulp would be about 1.7 million tons) and give them considerable pricing power as they would represent roughly 30% of global market capacity for eucalyptus pulp.

Please note that this is a rumor at this point and should be viewed as such.  I'll keep you updated regarding any developments.

"1241676","Paper Situation","It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Programmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is the last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are however, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we require to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these printers?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  What other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically included in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-packs of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

The reason for the cut was PAC non-firm tranny being cut that PSCO bought.  However they sold us a firm product.  PNM didn't know about the cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing power on the grid (Approx. time of notification 01:20).  We booked out with PSCO and PNM for HE 01 and HE 02 on the 4C345 part of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  For HE 03 25 MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO and PNM on the 4C345 piece of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  PSCO resupplied the power for HE 03 from SRP @ Mead 230.   The same thing happened for HE 06 as HE 03.  SRP resupplied  the power for HE 06.  I bought back for HE 06 from PSCO @ 4C345 and resold the power to SRP.

"78214","Change of Control Provisions","As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

"1111985","Kevin Presto comments on the summary of Bingaman bill","John -- Kevin Presto, head of East Power Trading, had these comments:

Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards -- Kevin says, ""NERC should be eliminated.""

Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure: -- Kevin says that the ""uniform reporting to consumers, in monthly electric bills, of the known energy sources"" is not good because it supports day-ahead source requirements for retail suppliers.  Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose how to source their portfolio, whether from bilateral contracts done on an ahead basis or purchases in the spot market.

John, the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill may alleviate this concern, but I don't know enough about how that works.  Several years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clean energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller of clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean credits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generator was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount of credits).  That program recognized that you can't specifically source a clean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way.  Thus, portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported.  But I don't know how this bill's provisions would work.  You probably have the Enron experts on this (used to be Janel G.)

Add to that the PV of the current contracts, approx $400mm, and you've got a total equity value of approximately $1.85bb.

While it is true that ENE is one of the most liquid names in the market, the entire market would move based on an order of $40 to $50 MM.  We have heard that there have been standing sell orders in the market totalling approximately $150 MM which have yet to be absorbed, it could be that the prices moved significantly in order for those sellers to find a buyer.

While this market is an important datapoint in evaluating the credit markets view of our name, it is not the sole determinant.  It is important to note that secondary trading levels of our bonds (a far more liquid market and accurate indicator of our ability to raise incremental capital) have only widened 5 - 10 basis points over the course of the day.

While I would very much like to tighten the spreads in the default swap market, I think that we need to keep those price markers  in perspective.

When (if) the Agreement is executed and returned by the Shipper, Deal Capture will handoff the original documents back to Contracts for activation and to complete all additional distribution and processing.

"1270616","The mystery is over!!","Much truth in this rapier thrust of humor.  As I continue to reflect on events, rumors and speculations, it strikes me that the Enron story seems to be unfolding as a story that is all about a kind of Rogue upper management thing.  The traditional fear of rogue trading, where a trader has control of the back office and spins off into a series of trades, each one designed to offset a previous bad one until the whole house of cards tumbles down,  this prototypical risk was carefully managed at Enron.  We actually have a very high quality trading business with good legal, accounting and settlement processes in place.  What we didn't have covered was a king of rogue financial sorcery thing by the very top executives.  Rogue balance sheet shenanigans  seems to be the problem.  It is a kind of corruption that is difficult to isolate and purge ourselves of.  Instead of isolating a single bad guy and firing him and then telling everybody all is well, this   kind of corruption seems to call for a  revolution from below, or, as seems increasingly likely, a takeover from without.   ----cgy","2","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","1","1"

Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.

I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

Now it's time to look forward.

With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

With RTOs, he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized, the number of RTOs becomes less important.  Those in the room, including EPSA staff, came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments.  Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline.  On the positive side, he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK.

"776097","U.S. pulp spot market prices flat","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices held flat even as buyers indicated some low-priced deals in softwood transactions. Some industry sources indicated that a closing between list prices and spot transactions could point to tighter supplies in spot markets later this year. Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest held at $410-440/tonne, 11.5% below August contract prices, paperloop sources said. Although there have been anecdotal cases of buyers procuring NBSK at $400/tonne in the Northeast, a producer asserted the deals must have come from one supplier.

Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also remained flat, holding its $390-420/tonne range of two weeks ago.

Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK), the only grade to hold flat in spot markets two weeks ago, remained unchanged at $340-380/tonne. Evidently moving to protect pricing, some mills last week curbed supplies even though buys were said to be available at typical spot prices. In a growing recent trend, one NBHK supplier closed a five-month deal at a fixed price of $370/tonne, on the high end of current spot prices but barely covering its cash cost of production.

Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) was unchanged and closed the week at $330-370/tonne.","3","2","3","3","2","1","2","3","3","2"

"1139216","New Contact Numbers - I am no longer with Enron","Don I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God hate to see pain hit a family member.  Even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and security knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  When you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill us with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work everything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your Christian walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities.

"743984","Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services","Harry & Nancy --

I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.  In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the ""customer of record"" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.

I violently agree with you on this point.  My belief is that we have the opportunity to hire and develop the intellectual capital to be expert in the risk evaluation and syndication side.  If we do not, then I do not think this will happen properly.  In addition to making good decisions and providing good (but not always heeded advice), we need to have the extra firepower and credibility to 'convert the heathens'.  I think that means more and more experienced people and some more structure.  The main point of my e-mail was to summarize that we have already recognized the need and are addressing from our end.  My last paragraph was an allusion to the fact that your concerns about the non-RAC responsibilities will become self-evident as we put a greater spotlight on this business and the teams begin to jell.  Where you and I may disagree is that rather than suggest that we have the situation in hand and will make incremental improvements, we need to at least consider that the window is open and let's jump through.

Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?

The point was acquired through a permanent capacity release transaction as a single point.

The problem is that they requested to combine this point into their current dpoa, contract 5002 that has points behind divisions.  The allocation reports he gets do not reflect this point since it is not in a division.  Can we make a point a division just so the reports can ""pick up"" the point?  Chris also mentioned that he does not want this point in a separate dpoa because he wants to be able to take advantage of the section 11 rights with their other delivery points on their dpoa.

"1302881","Progressive Flow Control","Progressive Flow Control (PFC)

Restrictions on seasonal allowance withdrawal in the OTR NOx market have been put in place through the establishment of PFC. This structure allows for unlimited banking of allowances. However, if the amount of banked allowances in any year exceeds 10 percent of the total regional emissions cap, any emission withdrawals in the subsequent period in excess of 10 percent of the cap must be withdrawn on a two-for-one basis; two allowances must therefore be withdrawn to offset one ton of NOX emitted.

Implementation of PFC is through a ratio which defines the percentage of each entity's bank available at 1:1. The ratio equals 10 percent of the next year's budget divided by the total bank. The ratio is applied evenly to all, regardless of whether their bank exceeds 10 percent of their own budget.

Progressive flow control, if triggered, has a large impact because it discourages allowance banking due to the possibility that allowances will be de-rated by 50 percent. In addition, withdrawals are more costly if they occur at 2:1. As a result, PFC leads to more dramatic NOX price spikes and valleys.","3","3","2","3","3","2","1","2","2","2"

"743217","Alliance Stakeholders Process Mtg, 8/14","At yesterday's FERC-faciliated meeting, stakeholders were successful in voicing concerns regarding constitution of an Advisory Board that would report to a non-independent entity, i.e. Bridgeco.  As a result, Alliance floated a proposal to constitute an interim independent board which stakeholders responded to, demanding signficant changes including an expanded scope of authority for that board.  Details of the discussions are included in the attached Word document.

On the matter of affilate representation on the Advisory Committee, Alliance agreed that the corporate entity must decide which segment it wishes to be represented in, and that the corporate entity could be represented via its affiliates in only one sector.

As the discussions were lengthy and mult-focused, I have captured most of the salient points in the attached document.  A meeting is scheduled for August 21st at 10am in Cincinnati, at which time the Alliance will present its interim independent board proposal incorporating to the extent it can stakeholders' concerns.  Where those concerns (identified in the attachment) cannot be incorporated, the Alliance promises to explain the reasons why.  Alliance hopes to circulate its revised proposal by close of business on the 20th, but if not will bring a written revised proposal to the meeting in Cincinnati.  I will attend the meeting if you wish.

The self-designation process initiated on the Alliance website to begin to constitute the Advisory Committee is being suspended, in view of the discussions yesterday.

"1258080","TRPA Park Place Entertainment Deal","Operations approves this transaction with the following notations:

1)  This is an approval for this deal only, and should not be taken as a blanket approval of additional retail deals.  Any additional retail deal should be separately considered through the TRPA process.

2)  UBSW Energy's processes and systems are designed to handle wholesale commodity transactions.  This single transaction will not suport the cost of system enhancements or changes to accommodate a retail deal.  Therefore, certain operational functions will be handled manually, and as such, are subject to a potential human error rate and reconciliation process that comes with the manual manipulation of data.  The Operations team will put the necessary additional checks and balances in place to mitigate these risks, but it should be noted that the risk of data errors will be inherently increased as a result of manual processes for a one-off transaction.

3)  The Operations team currently has the capacity to service this one-off, manually intensive transaction due to unused capacity in place to service UBSW Energy wholesale business.  When the wholesale business is once again in full swing, it is possible that the current Operations resources will be insufficient to service both the wholesale business and this one retail deal.  Requests for appropriate headcount additions would be presented on a business need basis.  To state the obvious, either the wholesale business or this retail transaction would have to have been priced lucratively enough to support the potential headcount addition(s).","1","1","2","1","1","2","2","2","3","2"
"1299246","Change of Control Provisions","As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.

Your assumption is not correct. The purchase contract calls for ProCaribe to pay the 3-day average Mont Belvieu around the bill of lading date plus 7 cents per gallon. Most likely that will be May 17, 18, and 21. I am proposing that the price formula be changed such that a % of the cargo will be a Fixed Price, another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for May, another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for June, and another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for July.

Since the forward curve increases between May and July, you should expect that if your May volume is priced at avg. of May plus 7 cents, then the June volume will be priced at the average of June plus something less than 7 cents, and the July volume will be priced at average of July plus something also less than 7 cents.

Belo issued its statistical report for the month of September.  Newspaper Group total revenues were down 10% in September on a pro forma basis. September 2001 had one more Sunday than September 2000.  Excluding the effect of the extra Sunday this year, Newspaper Group revenues were down approximately 16% . The Newspaper Group's revenue loss specifically related to the attacks was about $2 million.  At The Dallas Morning News, total full-run advertising linage, including preprints and supplements, was down 10.9% versus 2000.

First, Terry indicated that OneOk now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period.  They agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement, and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect.  It is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is, but any change is significant on this issue.  Second, Terry indicated that OneOk is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters are OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall.

Spencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their position.  In light of that, and of the apparent progress Dave made, Stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter.

"721467","Western Frontier update","I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality.

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

"1114450","budget questions","Major budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act together for the Delainey/Dietrich EES review tomorrow - Anthony Dayao, Beth Apollo and Kerry Roper will join me for a walk through.

Finalizing EIM budget will likely not get done today.  Can give you the details on why later today.  Will become obvious.

Just meet with Shankman and McConnell.  Not ready to finalize EGM budget yet.  They say that their commercial guys are waiting for Jeff Johnson to get with them on details of IT development projects.  I think that Jeff has been out for a few days, but I did see him on the 3rd floor when I was down there with Shankman and McConnell.  I will leave him a voice mail message to get an update on outstanding issues from his point of view.  Jeff and Mike want to have their stuff finalized by Friday.  I will convey that timeline to Jeff Johnson.

After EES budget prep meeting this afternoon, next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond EA to other commodities.  High priorty and very short time fuse on this one, for reasons that should be obvious.  I will have all of the Operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon, along with Ramesh Rao and others in IT who may be required to help us extract necessary info.","1","3","2","2","2","2","1","3","2","2"
"283828","Bammel Lease Question","I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.","3","2","2","3","2","1","1","1","2","1"
"899906","Credit issues","Lisa and Liz;

I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating with us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to compile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the end of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this afternoon which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our rights are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankruptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afternoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of the expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can declare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination payment and if they don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the cure periods in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  That's just one example.  Do you have any thoughts on this?","2","3","2","3","2","1","2","2","2","1"
"757251","Rockland Electric Transfer to PJM","On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

As in my email below to Daren, we are seeing some OA variances between flash to actual on the PLE contracts on PGEV for 10/00-12/00.  I have verified with Thu Nguyen of what the statements from PGEV show and that is also what we have booked in Unify and recorded to the G/L as an imbalance.  However, when looking in CPR (under CPR Pipeline Exchange), there was not anything flashed for those months, thus our OA variance.  I seem to remember that Stacy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month on occassion, in those few times that we do, 1)it should be relatively small and 2) in the following days of the next month, we should have worked the imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month.  In a voice mail from Daren today, he seemed to think the same thing was happening or even that by the end of each month, we were balanced to zero.  Can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have, why there would have not been anything flashed.  If we should not have had an imbalance, then we'll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that PGEV shows an imbalance on their statements.

"1114444","UK & Continental Power Doorstep","In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"

Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

"1037140","","John,  Very good idea to improve our integration as an organization.  If possible the best  timing is the last weekend in June.

With all the changes we have made I suggest an update of the major issues/ opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Also an overall sense of business strategy and focus would be helpfull.  From an HR standpoint I am not sure all understand the PRC  as a development tool, as well as an evaluation mechanism.   We need to find ways to incentivate new and creative business development that may not result in short term results.  A discussion of the HR development is key.

From a location standpoint there is a very nice  guest ranch with great conference facilities that Enron has used in the past located in Jackson, WY. They can accomodate all our team and also have plenty of outside activities that include horseback riding in the mountains which is much less stressfull than climbing but you get the same views.","2","1","1","1","2","3","2","2","2","2"
"288883","Crown Energy","I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.","3","2","3","3","3","3","3","2","2","3"

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

As each of you are aware, they are holding approximately 1.9 BCF of ENA's gas hostage as security for ENA's obligations under the storage/transport contracts.

On the sale of pad gas to Bridgeline, Brian and I need to speak with Gulf South tomorrow morning (as they have expressed an interest in buying the gas directly from us (instead of buying through Bridgeline which is why Bridgeline is interested in buying from us)).  Brian is of the view that by talking to Gulf South we may be able to maximize the amount that is ultimately paid.

I think we still have some legal questions about Louisiana state law the need to be answered in order to make a fully informed decision.

This evening  Steve and I had four separate schedules in which Mirant was cut by PAC transmission for several hours.  In each of these cases Mirant was unwilling to re-supply and was unwilling to contact the downstream counter parties.  It appears to me that they don't want to take the time to re-supply or are simply not competent enough to fill the schedules.  On three of these schedules I had to negotiate a book out for Mirant and on one I was able to re-supply.  In all of the recent cuts I have dealt with them on they have acted in a similar manner.  After discussing this issue with Cara, she thought it would be prudent to pass this information along to all of you.  If you have any further questions about this issue please feel free to contact me.","3","3","3","3","1","2","2","1","1","1"
"1303935","How's business?","I talked to Moma last night and she said that Daddy's cancer cells were all gone as far as the prostate cancer is concerned, as a result of the radiation.  She cautioned me not to get too excited because the Dr. said the cancer will reappear, but they don't know where.  She said Daddy has not been in any pain for a couple of weeks now.  It seems that the problem right now is the vomiting and nausea.  She said they had a Dr's appt. today to see about it.  She said Daddy is soooo skinney.

Daddy has not responded to my e-mail, so I think I am right,, because normally if you are alright financially, you quickly tell people, but in this case, I have not heard back from him.  Strange!  Anyway, if this is true, I might have to put my part-time employment ideas on hold for a little while longer, because I will not have them going without, and I will not have Momma going back to a regular full time job under any circumstances.  I was kind of thinking that anyway, with the stock market taking a nosedive the way it did with my retirement money.  Anyway, talk with you later.

P.S. I forgot to tell you that I am working out three times a week for an hour each time.  Our boss is letting us leave at 4:00 p.m. to go to the company gym to work out.

Daniel is the person in charge of the lunches, and he has not had an opportunity to prepare the monthly spreadsheets for August and September, which show the total amounts per day, and how much each cost center is charged.  He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly.  I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget.  Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September.  I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon.

I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced.  They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum.

I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.  I've included tips and delivery charges, since we're billed for those as well.","2","3","2","3","1","2","3","2","3","2"
"1241911","Bisti Motor Update","The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a ""stator"" failure this time versus the historic ""rotor"" failures that have occured at this facility.

Delainey and Janet have attempted to get her in EES consistently and Ed has already approached her about a move back to structuring.  Hunter and I have spoke with Deirdre and we are both strong on the bid.

The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed.  My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction.

"724984","TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)","DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER

I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3","1","2"

What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldn't do what we thought we had a right to do, even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination.  On top of that, no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the 11/15 gas day if we hadn't been lucky enough to have found it on our own.

Here is my analysis of my guys:

Mike Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he has run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations.  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Required to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop John Griffith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' elses positions.

"1111705","FERC Looking at ERCOT","The conventional wisdom around ERCOT is once direct assignment of the CSC congestion costs takes place, then flowing across the CSC does have a cost and those who schedule across will be more judicious.  The second assumption is that the stakeholders chose the wrong limiting element to be the monitored constraint.  90% of the congestion charges can be attributed to that wrong ""element"".  If direct assignmnet of the congestion and/or designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model.

I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.

"1311518","Was thinking very hard on your 100,000 mile up summary from Friday","Understand that this was clearly a very high level generalization.  But with regard specifally to the risk management teams, my sense is that the London team tends to address things more from a theoretical, academic perspective (raising lots of questions and talking about what ""should be"") and that the Houston team tends to be more action-oriented in the here-and-now (thus my reference to practical).  I think that this probably stems from two factors:  (1) the bank, financial, more formalized risk training that the London staff has had, versus the energy company, more physical commodity oriented, on-the-fly, in-the-trenches type of indoctrination of the Houston team; and (2) the difference in the magnitude of the businesses and the degree of maturity of the Houston and London commodity markets (smaller business with a less rapid and volatile trading environment lends itself to a more reflective, studied approach and a larger, rapidly paced market place creates less time for study and more need for quick, practical solutions).  I think sometimes that the London risk team conveys a feeling of superiority over their Houston counterparts with regard to their risk analysis skill set, their ""theorectical"" approach.  And sometimes the Houston team just wants to know why those London guys can't organize their processes, vacation schedules and holiday staffing to get time deadlines met, ""practical"" solutions that the Houston team has down to a science.   I see a lot of talent on both sides of the Atlantic, and believe that both camps can learn both academic and practical lessons from one another.  I would like to work with you to continue to search for ways to encourage that knowledge exchange and to build a better appreciation for everyone's contributions.

They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.

"1116086","Final Review","I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enough on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to spend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and accurate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also been a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day to day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business related issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of responsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That way nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went well otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitted to areas of improvement.

Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the group. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accounting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month and secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the reports that we produce are used.","3","2","2","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"

A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost never buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2. We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with regards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you have questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September.","1","2","1","1","2","3","2","1","2","2"

"1359486","Transactional Finance","Sounds like a great idea to get together and discuss.  We definitely need to own this process.  I am not sure Marshall or the orignation team has much understanding of the true value of this from of credit risk syndication.  We have reviewed some of these policies in the past and enforcing claims is not as clean as cash or l/c's.  Legal opinion was not very favorable in the past either.  I am not sure how much of this we should do and what precedent it sets for the rest of our portfolio.  If we do any it should be centralized on predictable credit exposures (A/R or annuities) and not volatile MTM exposures.

That being said, we have big targets in ugly credit markets which will require we take on some more risk.

"764697","Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles","The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.

In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.","2","3","1","2","1","2","2","3","1","1"
"1111704","FERC Looking at ERCOT","Here are a couple of clarifying points:

The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge.  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation.

When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit.

It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion.","3","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","2","2"

I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at ""41"" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.

"743252","EPSA Meeting Today On Barton RTO Draft","The EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft.  In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning, I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere ""technical corrections"" were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal, as the EPSA draft letter stated.  Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS), a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft.

He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members, without naming them, didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse.  These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion.  Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft.  I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities.

While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting, you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members.  I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant, but I can't prove it.

Joan has talked to Leigh-Leigh Baillio about taking pictures of the family. The sitting fee is $85 (if other family units want pictures it would be an additional $20 per family plus the cost of film). The cost per picture varies by the size and quantity ordered. Joan is getting actual prices from Leigh-Leigh. As a rough estimate, Joan spent about $300 on three 8x10's plus some smaller prints.

I thought we could take the portrait after Jim & Marianna's second baby is born . . . maybe the weekend of her baptism? . . . so there wouldn't be any actual money paid until the Spring.

This sets up a bearish  divergence back down and a minimum target back under 1856.  I have an  hourly sell signal once crude takes out the low of the highest hourly bar.   Call if any questions.

"104385","Oslo Credit Watch Report","Dear Stacey-

What is your view point on this?  It appears to me that what Rod is saying is that this is not a valid doorstep finding because of the other controls that they have around the process.  However, I would think that commercial having a credit watch report would be beneficial at the beginning of each trading day (or at least a list of the CP's that are approaching their limits) so they know what CP to focus on.  What are thoughts?  Does commercial here get a credit watch report daily?  Do they use it?  Please call me to discuss when you get a chance.  Thanks, Stacey.  I appreciate your input.

"1247024","Thank You for Your Hard Work","Mr. Lay:

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all the hard work you are trying to do, and continue to try to do, on behalf of those of us who will always be proud to call Enron 'home'.  I joined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the leap. I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by orders of magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I cannot help but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional success and satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always carry the confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the business.  I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame where it does not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, laying blame may soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are still many at Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energy markets in the United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As I, like many others, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I will leave with mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such an awesome organism like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and thoughts are with you as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses, and again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of Enron.  I will always be proud to have worked under your direction and leadership.

Best Regards,

Andrew Kosnaski","3","3","2","3","1","1","3","3","1","1"

They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate.

Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.

They approached us on Wednesday to try to increase the margin required, even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5+ years ago.  I refused to agree to change the margin calculations.  It became clear that Man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that Man is a relatively small shop.  I agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account.  At the same time I told them I was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handle/didnt want the clearing business I would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make.  Clear our business always, or clear it never.  Paribas has stuck with us throughout and I intend to clear the majority of future biz with Paribas.  I agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday, which we did, but the rest of the position would stay there.  They agreed.

"1117793","Confirms in Word","You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NOT flow around the structure.  If you read the confirms, you will see that Enron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically at the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated).  Thus, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for that margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Our swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but in essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margin MSCG.  Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not receive any.  If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, you wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the money they prepay you as collateral.  Hope it is clear - I am out of the office tomorrow, but I will be back on Monday.

"4680","Spread Update","We've been experimenting with spreads on EOL and I want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on EOL.

Assume you want to put out the COB/MC spread -4 at 4.  Also assume COB is 275 at 300.  As you know, if you put this out in the broker market, you would expect to buy COB $4 under Mid-C or sell COB $4 over.

If you want to duplicate these trades on EOL you could put out COB/MC -4 at 4, but here is what's going to happen (assume COB mid is 287.5).  If somebody 'hits' your 'bid' you will sell COB at 287.5 and buy Mid-C at 283.5.  If somebody 'lifts' your 'offer' you will buy  COB at 287.5 and sell MC at 291.5.  Effectively the EOL transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid, or the title is COB/MC but the transaction is MC/COB.  The problem it seems to me is that, fundamentally, bid is always first, offer is second.  For this to work as is, the market would have to accept that, in all cases bid/offer applies except with EOL spreads where it's offer/bid.

This seems too confusing to me.  I'm not sure how you guys feel about  it, but I want to give you a heads up.","3","3","2","3","2","2","2","1","2","1"
"772876","End-user Agreement Processes","I agree with Lynn's comments with one exception. My understanding is that PGAS was to be simply a vehicle to provide the end user volumes to Gas Logistics, in addition to the TBS volumes, as is current practice. We want to pursue having these volumes supplied to Measurement  via email so that they can be imported electronically. Again, these are not  OMVs in the traditional sense, since custody transfer has occurred on the TBS volumes. There is currently no mechanism in place to compare the TBS volumes to the end user volumes other than manually. Additionally, due to the time of the month that these numbers are received, I'm not sure that there is sufficient time to argue the accuracy of the numbers . Currently, paragraph 4. of the End User agreement states ""The Shipper's transportation agreement will be billed on the actual measured takes at the End User's POI."" It does not address any differences between the TBS volumes, positive or negative, other than Shipper is responsible for any imbalances resulting from the measured volumes at the End User POI. There are no provisions to challenge the accuracy of the numbers being supplied. Lynn is probably right that we will need some  additional discussions on this.

"1105679","Article","February/March 2001 Issue  Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at Enron. ""When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented,"" says Thuraisingham.   The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases. ""There is a premium in the price for firm delivery,"" says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. ""most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market,"" says Thuraisingham.","2","3","2","3","1","3","2","1","3","2"

Can you schedule 30 minutes after trading on Tuesday to discuss.  I will have a model for you to test.

"305183","Crown Energy","I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.","2","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","2"
"340","LADWP","Bill,

I had quite a bad conversation with Kirk at LADWP yesterday.  Geir supposedly purchased only spinning reserves from LA however, when I called to verify this Kirk at LA said that Geir bought power from him at $50 on top of the reserves.  When I called Geir he said he didnt.  Therefore I called back Kirk at LA and told him that Geir said he didnt purchase power from him and that we would just pull the tapes in the morning to solve the dispute.  Kirk then proceeded to go on a three minute tirade about how he ""isnt even supposed to deal with Enron"" and was doing us a big favor because he doesnt want to deal with us anyway.  He completely erupted on me and was absoulutely unprofessional  and  cursed at me several times during the entire conversation.    I kept trying to calm him down however, he just continued to rant.   Anyway we will probably need to pull tapes for Giers conversations with LA. I would imagine from about 16:00 thru my conversation with Kirk at 18:05.  Please let the guys know that when dealing with LADWP to be absoulutely clear, to state exactly what they are purchasing, be specific when stating time zones etc, as it appears that any dispute these guys will just proceed to completely melt down on us which in the end just causes problems for EPE.

"1285334","Northwest Reserves","We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds.  $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.","3","1","2","2","2","3","3","2","2","3"

"1311871","Non-Elective IT Support Staffing for EBS -  2002","Following this week's discussions, we have recalculated the absolute minimum number of people required to keep your present systems in production.  In recalculating this number, we have eliminated everything except that which is required for ""non-elective"" maintenance.  Although many of the systems have been in operation for some time, we still frequently encounter problems which interrupt production.  Such events require emergency attention and are what we refer to as ""non-elective"" maintenance.  Therefore, in recalculating these support staff, we have excluded any effort for improvements or other changes that the users have previously identified for next year's work.  Also, we are suggesting excluding any further effort on the Saber Settlement, GeoQual, Market Intelligence, DPC Tax & Media Services systems which we will simply wrap up as those are and put them in ""moth balls"" for possible future use.  As the result of this process, we have come to a core minimum number of 19 people required to simply ensure that the remaining systems continue to function.  The only way that we can logically reduce this core number any further would be to ""turn off"" other production systems.  Although we recognize that the concept of turning-off other production systems is unattractive, it would be far better to have this happen in a planned, orderly fashion than having them crash in an unrecoverable condition later.

"1358202","","John,  Very good idea to improve our integration as an organization.  If possible the best  timing is the last weekend in June.

With all the changes we have made I suggest an update of the major issues/ opportunities in each one of our businesses.  Also an overall sense of business strategy and focus would be helpfull.  From an HR standpoint I am not sure all understand the PRC  as a development tool, as well as an evaluation mechanism.   We need to find ways to incentivate new and creative business development that may not result in short term results.  A discussion of the HR development is key.

From a location standpoint there is a very nice  guest ranch with great conference facilities that Enron has used in the past located in Jackson, WY. They can accomodate all our team and also have plenty of outside activities that include horseback riding in the mountains which is much less stressfull than climbing but you get the same views.","1","2","2","1","1","2","2","2","2","1"

Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.

In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.

"1359419","Systemic Market Risk to Follow NYMEX Failure","RICK:

Thanks for your note and staying in touch during a time when a huminatarian crises could easily spiral into something  where the worste news is yet to come.   Here is what Ive found out...

NYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up clearing, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past, the first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though the later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse payments have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange is likely to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating the need for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an effort is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above (based on yet to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some degree of transaction data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment performance from NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing payment delays extend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we may see delayed payments from weaker credits in related swap and physical markets.  In this regard, the markets have breathing room since the terrorist attacks didnt occur late in the month.  Finally, there have been general comments from Treasury and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock exchange payments, and the assumption is that the same guarantees would apply to the NY commodity exchanges (but this asumption has not been validated or addressed directly in public comments).  Hope this helps.  Brad.","2","3","2","3","1","1","2","2","3","1"

November 29, 2001 10:51 AM ET

TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A radio broadcaster known as ""Dave the Dwarf"" has sued to overturn Florida's ban on ""dwarf tossing,"" saying he should be allowed to decide for himself whether to participate in the barroom contests.  ""Dwarf tossing"" is a contest in which dwarfs don harnesses and allow bar patrons to hurl them through the air onto mattresses.  Florida banned it in 1989 amid intense lobbying from the advocacy group Little People of America, which said the contests were demeaning and encouraged people to treat dwarfs as objects. Bars that allow the contests can be stripped of their liquor licenses.  David Flood, a dwarf who is 38 inches (96.5 cm) tall, filed suit on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, challenging the ban as unconstitutional. He said it illegally singles out people with dwarfism.  ""As soon as you have a physical handicap ... all of the sudden they treat you like you don't have a mind of your own,"" Flood told the Tampa Tribune. ""Just because I'm 3-foot-2 doesn't mean I can't make decisions.""  Flood, 37, works as ""Dave the Dwarf"" on the morning radio show on Tampa station WFLZ.","3","3","2","3","2","3","3","1","2","2"

Subject to the provisions of Section 17.3(h) above, Customers may resolve their monthly transportation imbalances by trading their imbalance with another Customer. If requested by Customer, Texas Gas will post imbalances available for trades on its EBB. Customers trading offsetting imbalances must provide Texas Gas a notice of their agreement to trade imbalances in writing and signed by both Customers. All imbalance trades must be completed within ten (10) days of the date Texas Gas renders notice to Customer as to their monthly transportation imbalance. Customers must make-up in-kind or cash out all monthly transportation imbalances not resolved through trading in accordance with Section 4 of these General Terms and Conditions.

Since the imbalance data sent to ENA was dated November 10th,   then it appears that TODAY would be the last day to trade this imbalance.

"53324","EOL Pricing Algorithm","Hi Bob,

some comments :

1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.

2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).","2","1","2","1","2","2","2","3","2","2"

We had another unpleasant experience with Hildago last night.  This is the third different individual at EPMI who has had an interaction with him resulting in a hassle.  The other day I wrote it off to my fault, but since it has happened with 2 other people here, and only with Hildago, I now believe the problem is him.  He has a natural antagonistic demeanor that makes people defensive and angry.  When he calls he accuses us of not meeting our obligations and demands information and says things like, ""if you do not provide this information I will turn you in.""   We understand our responsibility to provide outage information to the ISO.  We are diligent in completing outage reports and submitting them to the outage coordination desk at the ISO.  The ISO is requiring an additional communication with the Real Time group to either: 1) confirm that the outage ended as planned, or 2) change the outage timing if required.  Although, to my knowledge, this requirement is not in the ISO tariff, and has not been communicated to SCs in writing in any way, and furthermore is a waste of time for everyone, will make efforts to do this.  The ISO should recognize, however, that in most cases, our Real Time Group is not aware of outages our generator SC clients, nor should they be, as these units our off line and therefore ""out of play"" in Real Time.  Hildago should work to communicate better and treat people with respect.  He clearly is not doing that with us.

I think that we can readily distinguish the competitive nature of the deal information requested here (including book outs and when we entered the transaction) with the transparent data that we want the one (regional) grid operator/RTO to provide in real time, including MCP, transmission outages, etc..  I agree that we should examine our avenues for opposing parts of this.   I think Elizabeth has asked Sam Behrens to help Enron on this.

Also, when is this data required to be posted?  I don't think that our traders use the current quarterly filings of competitors for much data, other than the bottom line amount sold for ranking the power marketers.  Therefore, our typical argument that we can absorb info better than competitors (even when we have to show ours), may not be applicable here (Susan, you may want to check with Kevin and Tim on that).","2","3","1","2","1","2","2","3","2","2"
"1261119","Status of November PPA","Closing the December business is first priority for GMS. Due to just completing the October PPAs, nothing will be done on the November PPAs until after the close of December's business. Conceivably, we could have two or three or more months of PPAs to process during any given commodity close, depending on when the charts are received, and the necessary time allocated for processing that does not interfere with the current month's business. As I also mentioned, we currently have no way to systematically determine which stations that charts have not been received from, and require PPAs. This is a labor intensive process to make the determinations and complete the PPA process. To my knowledge, the field is still working on a plan to expedite charts to Houston for processing. Until such time that the charts can be received for processing prior to close, we will have to continue to process the data twice; closing with the index readings to accommodate the GISB 5th work day requirements , and again when the charts arrive to accommodate determining the daily values. We probably need to look at this entire process, starting at the field level,  to completion of the billing process to ensure that the expectations are realistic for all involved, and we are pursuing the best course of action. Additionally, some of the existing timelines and deadlines in the process may need to be changed until physical equipment is installed in the field to eliminate the problem. A note of observation: no charts for the last half of December, with the exception of the ones that are over-nighted from Minnegasco, has been received by GMS for the close on 1/08/02.

We need to clarify in the last sentence that the assignment upon merger may occur without consent upon a merger event.

"1311531","Team building event for my direct reports","Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from ""above"" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally","3","1","2","2","3","2","2","1","2","2"
"1242448","Albuquerque Region Outage Report Through December 2002","Dan,

We will have pipeline repairs to do on the mainline in sections 7 & 8,  between Stations 6 and 8.  PII is running a LAPA program on the smart pig results from the pigs ran last September.  Once the LAPA results are complete, probably within the next 2 weeks, Earl Chanley will put together a scope and estimate of work.  We don't have a date for the work yet, but probably will be in the May/June time frame.  These smart pig runs are a part of Transwestern's Risk Management Demo Project with OPS.  We will probably have to take the mainline to 60% MAOP for repairs, so there is a possibility for flow restrictions.

We also have budgeted to smart pig the Crawford Lateral this year.  Regulating flow for the proper pig speed may cause flow restrictions.  We don't have a date for this pig run yet.  I'll work with Jeff, Max Brown, Darrell Schoolcraft, and Earl Chanley to schedule this and the pipeline repairs in section 7 & 8.

"4464","-$141,000 P&L hit on 8/13/01","Sean:

I have been looking at the -$141K P&L hit in ""Other Changes"" on 8/13/01 you were inquiring about.  The biggest ""contributor"" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a. 2nd Order in financial terms).  I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).  Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e. Second Order).  This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.

Anyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).    I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.

I am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.  In the mean time, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please feel free to let me know.","3","2","2","3","2","2","3","2","3","3"

Unless and until we get all of our ""positive"" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their ""goofy"" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.

Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.

"1111874","meeting with Commissioner Nora Brownell","Barbara and I had the opportunity to meet with FERC Commissioner Brownell, who was in Columbus today to speak at the Ohio Energy Summit.

Her presentation stressed the sea change at FERC and called for aggressive cooperation of all stakeholders to develop a common market design and interconnection procedures for all RTOs.  Barbara and I were able to meet her after her presentation for a half hour or so, during which time she stated that the common tariff she anticipated coming out of the RTO related discussions at FERC would likely prompt many lawsuits filed by the incumbent utilities.  She urged, of course, that Enron be represented during the FERC RTO Week discussions, which will be sharply focused on technical market structure issues rather than governance.

We had the opportunity to discuss several Ohio-specific concerns, including the current complaints before the Ohio Commission regarding the incumbents' disregard of their agreements to serve all load under the same terms and conditions of the OATT.  She took note of our points regarding the impact of differential imbalance protocols and OASIS information posting, and suggested the upcoming RTO discussions would present the opportunity to discuss those and other issues generically.  She also commended Ohio Chariman Schriber for the interest he has expressed to her and to the Ohio congressional delegation in resolving wholesale electricity market issues.  It was announced at the Summit by Governor Taft that Schriber will head a Federal Energy Policy Group to promote the establishment of  wholesale markets that support a robust retail choice program for Ohio.

I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.

Now it's time to look forward.

With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.   Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).

Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.   This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.

I never was really assigned to ""audit"" the Appalachian suppliers.  I was midway through another Appalachian project , when I realized that there were several transport and purchase related issues.  So, I began compiling a Supplier Reference Book to get a better picture of supplier's activity.  I used this book to verify price change request.  I also used it to identify several incorrect requests for pricing adjustments and errors in Settlements' calc-sheets.  My concern for additional purchase errors led me to the review most of the Appalachian purchase deals.  It was during one of these activities that I identified the Adkin's payment errors.  I'm sorry, but I don't have any documented ""audit"" findings.  Any correspondence I did have was lost in the conversion to Outlook.  I do still maintain my Supplier Reference Book, but I don't think it would be much help.  However, I did review the CGAS IF pricing the for the year prior to the deal.  Only one month during that time was the index price higher than the contracted $3.075.  In fact they were considerably lower.  Also, I've reviewed the settlement statements, it appears we paid Mr. Adkins for three months before the error was caught.  The first month was paid at index (index was $0.06 lower than the contract price), the next month was paid at index ( index was $0.22 higher than contract price) and the third month was corrected to the $3.075 ( index was $4.53).

"947352","EOL Pricing Algorithm","Hi Bob,

some comments :

1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.

2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).","3","2","2","3","2","2","2","2","2","2"

as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening,","1","2","1","1","1","2","1","1","3","1"

"59216","Portland Lease","I had a brief discussion with Marcus Buergler on Tuesday regarding the Portland space.  I indicated to him that our desire would be to move, but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made.  In the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money.  On top of that, there are roughly $600k worth of improvements (separating from PGE) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce.

Based on my very brief discussion with Marcus on Tuesday, I was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building.  I learned today that the Estate has accepted the PGE lease for this space and that we have to stay here.  This is very depressing if it is true.

From a money point of view I don't think that it is the best decsion.  More importantly, from a morale point of view this place is horrible.  We have 15,000 square feet when we need between 5,000 and 10,000.  It is absolutely depressing here.  People are very much in favor of moving.

That can be done with or without an EAMR in the mix (except for the construction) and actually get us a benefit 	in a future rate case as whatever is left of the value at that point in time becomes rate based.

"2983","Weird Deal Change Yesterday *********CRITICAL - PLEASE INVESTIGATE ********************","All,

This morning, I spoke with Chris Mallory, Phil Platter, Diana Scholtes, and Serena Bishop about the deal change mentioned below.  I want to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding how the deal change occured and the changes we are making to prevent it from happening again.  Since FSP and EnPower are fully integrated systems, EnPower can add and edit FSP data and FSP can add and edit EnPower data.  Presently, when a new schedule is created in FSP Schedule Blotter, the new schedule, related deal, and FSP extension data are created.  When a schedule is edited in FSP Schedule Blotter, the related deal information is synchronized to match those changes.  Yesterday, during the FSP production parallel, a schedule was zeroed out and the resulting deal synchronization caused the ""wierd deal change"".  FSP is being changed to no longer synchronize deal information of existing deal to match schedule changes made in FSP Schedule Blotter.  No editing of existing deal information (peer, leg or term) will be allowed via the FSP Schedule Blotter.  We have also been asked to review how FSP changes are reflected in the audit tables to make sure they are reflected like the changes from other EnPower applications.

"56550","ECP Swaps","I've spoken with Pushkar regarding the ECP interest rate hedges. There were two sets of hedges put in place. Notional value of $32.68mm executed 5/16/2000 and $350mm on 3/15/2001. I have asked Pushkar to research the cash flows he hedged to determine how those tranche sizes came about.

The Fair Value of Enron's equity and sub debt (net of the $30mm Merlin piece) per the DASH of December 7, 2000 indicated a value at that time of $360mm. Additionally, the DASH assumed further gain in the base case of approximately $8mm suggesting there might have been $368mm of value to hedge. Because the generic five year Treasury yields also declined from 5.262% on Dec 7 (DASH date) to 4.508% by March 15 (closing/hedging date), the value of the El Paso fixed cash flow stream would have increased in value above $368mm (perhaps to the $380mm range - that's what I've asked Pushkar to check), it would seem to indicate that the original hedges were rolled into the subsequent hedges to represent the value of the entire transaction at final closing. In that case, the original Linden 6 hedges would not be open positions at all but rather a part of the hedging strategy that was required at closing per the executed DASH.

Pushkar has indicated he will look into his files to ascertain how the hedges were sized. Assuming the above accurately portrays what occurred, it would appear the transaction steps at execution followed the DASH requirements. I will followup as early as possible next week.

According to sources, this is ""locked in to pass.""  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on Monday.

The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to either operate unprofitably or shut down.

SINGAPORE, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com ) - Market pulp trading is growing in China in line with the country's healthy economic growth, but it is slumping in Korea as a result of the country's weakening coated woodfree paper exports to China. Sources said that although buying activity is picking up, Chinese traders are keen to destock their full inventories, putting a stop to any upward moves for NBSK and radiata pine pulp prices. Spot prices for these two grades have stayed flat at $390-410/tonne and $370-390/tonne, respectively, since early July.

Mill downtime and reduced woodchip supplies have impeded trading of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood in Asia. But a flurry of Brazilian eucalyptus to the region has filled the gap. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices have edged up at the lower end to $360-370/tonne, up from $340-370/tonne in mid-July. Brazilian eucalyptus prices also shifted up $10/tonne at the lower end of the range, taking prices to US$360-370/tonne. Sources reported that large volumes of pulp from Latin America were being shipped to China in July following orders placed earlier. These include Brazilian eucalyptus and radiata pine from Chile.

"273479","Calpine","You have the relationship with Paul, so I would suggest that you go.  I think that only one of the two  of us needs to be there, given the additional attendee list of Tom, Tommy, Sheri and Bob.  I would say that of that group, the most credible (i.e. knowledge of the business, the operations functions and our systems that support them) are Bob Hall and Tommy.  If you feel like we should cut down the number of Enron attendees, this is just my two cents worth.

Just for a time frame reference regarding Thomas McAndrews departure date, I took the role over operations in January 1997.  I still owe you the bear in the bicycle story over a beer sometime to give you an idea of the state of the union when I took the role.  We did a lot of upgrading of personnel in 1997, changed our internal definitions of acceptable performance, and created dedicated teams to work on the implementation of Sitara and Unify (in 1998 ad 1999).  We probably weren't doing a great job in operations when Thomas left.

I got with Sheri right after our meeting and gave her slides that I thought would be most effective in the presentation.  I also gave her appropriate stats for operational performance.  I will review the revised presentation tomorrow morning before you see the next version.","3","2","1","2","3","2","3","1","1","2"

"1273023","","As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

"894724","London - LPG Book","Lousie,

I would be grateful if you could review the transaction below, which will require your approval.   As outlined below the client 'Borealis'  wishes to change the terms of the contract given our current situation.  RAC is comfortable with the changes, as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the LPG trader to flatten his book. Further, whilst there maybe the potential of MTM movement between the $180 purchase price from Borealis and the subsequent sale (index related price) back to the counterpart, this will be netted out.  RAC has significant risk appetite for this counterpart, which is a sound credit, rated E5.  The only issue is whether Houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early, which could range between $1,200,000-1,400,000.  If this is feasible I will recommend that we negotiate a discount of $15 on storage costs (saving $600,000) as opposed to $10.

Also, on page 13 - # 26 & 27, is there any benefit to more specifically describing why we ""understood"" and why they ""knew"" that the San Juan lateral contract would be base loaded due to their long-term firm supply arrangement with Pan Alberta that existed prior to and after the Global Settlement rates were negotiated?  FERC is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving PGT, NWPL, TW, Pan Alberta, SoCal and SoCal's affiliate, PITCO.  It would seem a huge oversight on SoCal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with TW was not memorialized in the Global Settlement or in TW's tariff.  This is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes SoCal transports under contract 8255 and allegedly SoCal and TW had some verbal agreement (with a 10 year term) that would apply to these volumes.","1","1","2","1","1","2","1","1","2","1"

--  Red Lake / (Pataya) Storage  - per the press release, Aquila has purchased 100% of this project being developed by SouthWest Gas.  The proposed 12 Bcf facility, located 30 miles north of Kingman, Arizona near the terminus of TW, will begin its open season the week Feb. 4.  They anticipate tying into both TW and El Paso.  We are exploring options with Aquila to tie in the Sun Devil project plus a new compressor at Kingman, AZ.  The compressor will help Aquila buck TW's line pressure plus facilitate pressure requirements at the California border for TW.

--  Drafting new marketing proposals to both APS and Panda based on the lowered facility costs.

Engineering -  New facility costs are estimated at $831 million and include an additional lateral to serve the APS Red Hawk plant.  Capacity to Phoenix will be 750,000 MMBtu/d with only 30,000/d available for Cal Border.  This is a $100 million improvement versus our original scenario.  The improvements are based on reduced pipe looping to serve Cal Border plus reduced or eliminated compressor stations.  The benefit is reflected in a lower initial capital cost plus lower annual operating expenses.  Rates to Phoenix are estimated at $0.45/MMBtu on a 20 year term with a project salvage value of less than $200mm at the end of the initial term.","1","3","1","1","1","3","2","2","3","2"

In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.

If however you do it for the other groups EGS will need to be included from a political standpoint.  I tend to try and stay on top of this throughout the year.  The key question we are going to have to answer is whether or not bonuses and LTI's will be awarded as usual.

You may want to check on one thing.  In 1997 or 1998 Skilling capped the bonuses of Section 16b officers.  He told me it was required under the compensation program since Enron had a loss ( Jay Block and MTBE write-off).  The reduction in the cash bonus was made up with a grant of restricted stock for the difference.  I assume this was correct.  If the compensation program has not been amended you might have restrictions on cash awards to 16b officers that should be communicated.  That could cause some issues!

I have sold my 1,800 shares of Enron Corp. because I no longer  have faith in the board to be a good watchdog for the best interests  of the shareholders.  I just don't understand how senior managers can  manipulate the financial results of the company for the past five years and only  recently be discovered.  I expect the board to act as more than a lap-dog  for senior management.  I am encouraged you turned down the chance to  accept a $60 million payday for this merger that salvages what little  shareholder value remains in Enron.  I would expect the board to seek  repayment of any and all bonuses paid to senior managers based on these  inaccurate financial results, including the estimated $30 million paid to the  CFO, who allegedly is the architect of this scheme to defraud  stockholders.  Had I known the company was apparently built on smoke and  mirrors, I would have sold my stock long ago and not be forced  to watch my  children's college fund be pocketed by executives who have little regard for the  stockholders they were hired to serve.  I guess the only lesson I can take  from this is that no company, no matter how large or prestigious is safe from  dishonest management.

Would the Spot agreement take the place of the Firm agreement?  If not, would having both agreements in place create any overlaps or conflicts?

I have indicated the kinds of adjustments from the PJM platform necessary to make it work.  I don't think is necessary to take a swing at Mark Mayer of BPA to make our point that LMP will work.  Mark was caught flat footed and unprepared for Dick O'Niell's cheap shot.  Second, the proportion of hydro and the mix of other units is quite different in PJM and NYISO, so the fact that they fit hydro in around the edges is not necessarily proof that it will work in the PNW.  For that reason, I have noted the mix of units (hydro and base load) to show that the unit committment process will be different but you can still produce hourly prices.","1","2","1","1","2","2","2","2","1","1"

We discussed the potential of Jacobs acquiring NEPCO over a period of time. Noel listened, but it was difficult to determine his interest. We outlined a program where Jacobs, after a confidentiality agreement is in place, would send a couple of people to meet with Dick and I for a one day summary review of NEPCO. If there is interest from that review, then we would proceed to a management introduction and due diligence.  Noel stated he would keep our approach in confidence, but needed to review the opportunity with a couple of people and would get back to us next Monday, Oct. 29.  From past experience, I know Joe Jacobs, the founder, will be involved in any acquisition decision and I am sure that is the focus of Noel's review. I am sure Noel will also test his sources on NEPCO.

In a side note, Jacobs shares have been doing very well as of late and are almost back to their historic high.

If they decide to keep 1 plane, it could go either way. If they decide to keep both planes, the assumption is that they will keep the Hangar. The lease is approx. $180K. I described our use of the Hangar as the Interim Offsite for Gas Logistic's Business and Gas Control functions and will send her the Visio drawings showing the configuration of the rooms we are using. I also described the T1 network connections between the Hangar and downtown and the Hangar and Omaha. She said that our use of the facility would probably be listed as one of the benefits and she assumed there would be some costs to relocate the Interim Offsite if they cancel the lease.

Mark Greenberg, myself and the attorney for TFS are working out the details for the definitive agreement.  The revised copy was sent out this afternoon.  If all goes well, it should close next week.  There are a few issues that could delay it but the chances of that happening are low.

TradeSpark was eager to see a contract.  I had an agreement sent out yesterday to Michael Williams that included North American Natural Gas, Power, Coal, Emissions, Broadband and Weather for $500,000.  Of course, Michael wanted to discuss putting the prices on TradeSpark.  I told him that the contract will only deal with the ability to transact on behalf of his clients.

"877635","NGI's Article on the Decision Delay","Initial ALJ Decision in Transwestern Case Delayed

FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. has extended by two weeks the deadline for an initial decision in the case in which Transwestern Pipeline is alleged to have arranged more lucrative negotiated-rate deals last winter prior to posting available firm transportation capacity to its web site -- a move that extracted higher rates and limited the capacity availability for recourse-rate shippers for service to California.

Due to ""scheduling conflicts,"" Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15.

FERC ordered the hearing in late July to determine whether Transwestern exercised market power in arranging negotiated-rate contracts for capacity that led to some shippers being charged up to $27/MMBtu in February, which the Commission estimated was ""70 times the recourse rate.""","2","2","2","2","2","3","2","1","2","2"

"4620","Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product","I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!","1","3","3","3","2","3","3","1","1","2"

Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3"

I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto/MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine.  In addition, I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow.

My group gathers the gas and power physical volumes that are used in quarterly press releases, SEC filings and other communications.  Investor relations typically likes to look at this information on a monthly basis to make sure that they understand the direction that volumes are going.  The attached file details gas and power volumes by region for the most recent periods.  The gas volumes from July to August of this year show a slight downward trend that I wanted to make sure that you were aware of.  We pull this information from the Unify settlement system and have rarely had problems with the accuracy of that data.  None the less, we typically run it by desk heads when the numbers don't seem to fit our expectations.  After a brief review by the Central and East guys they told us that lower price volatility and the ICE trading platform were the significant reasons for the decline.

"77739","DEC. MRT GAS","ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg).

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow).

"44497","ERCOT load growth (April through August)","I estimate that ERCOT load growth for the period of April through August 2001, as compared to April through August 2000, to be near 3%.  Initially, I believed that figure to be high.  However, Texas non-farm employment increased 2.3%, year over year (2001 over 2000), for the time period in question.  Since load growth closely follows economic growth, the 3% figure appears to be reasonable.  As we know, the economy is slowing.  One place it shows up is in the non-farm employment data.  Texas non-farm employment in the months of April through July grew 3.2% from 1999 to 2000, compared to 2.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.  For the first seven months of 2001, non-farm employment grew at an annual rate of 1.3%, while in the first seven months of 2000, it grew at a 2.7% annual rate.  This data indicates that ERCOT load growth for the remainder of 2001 will slow from the 3% rate.

To arrive at an estimate of load growth, I estimated loads using typical ERCOT weather for the periods of April through August 2000 and April through August 2001.  For the 2000 load estimate, the total ERCOT load model was estimated from 1/1/1998 through 3/31/2000.  For the 2001 load estimate, the total ERCOT load model was estimated from 1/1/1999 through 3/31/2001.  The loads from 2000 and 2001 were tabulated and compared.  The results, along with some economic data, were used to arrive at an annual load growth estimate.

"104357","Reserve (Schedule C) for PX deals","We intend to reserve $5.5 million associated with PX Index-based deals with third parties that we did in January.  The $5.5 million represents the amount by which we underpaid some of our services customers relative to the PX index.  NO P&L IMPACT.  Amounts currently sitting as annuities in Enpower.  We should release this reserve when the California refund case is completed and new/final PX MCPs are published by FERC.

The story goes like this ... We typically buy power from our services customers at a PX Index price.  Throughout January we entered PX Index based purchases from our services customers into Enpower.  At the same time, Foster was negotiating a certain $150/MWh payment to our customers given all of the noise around the PX, the weird prices that it was printing, and the $150/MWh soft price cap that FERC had in place.  We settled with our customers based on the $150 value.  Most of our customers were fine with this.  To do this we entered annuities into Enpower for the difference between the PX price and the $150 price.  These annuities have been ""hanging out there"" since January.  We should have run those annuities through the books and reserved the amount when we settled with our customers (I am assured by Foster and Postelthwaite that we have properly settled with our customers).  Somewhere between our middle market team and our risk group in Portland the annuities were never run through the books (you may recall that we lost two of our three people on our risk desk at this same time).  Foster or Wolfe should have caught this.

I  completely agree with Dave .In addition to the levels of redundancy he states  it is important to note that the Central Control Centers are more of a communication and dispatch hub but the actual control of  the circuit breakers , transformers, phase angle regulators and  voltage control devices(the reliability backbone) resides within the ""sub control centers "" of the Transmission Operators like Con Edison, Florida Power &Light  etc etc..The destruction of one of the major RTO control centers will not shut down transmission lines or trip generators off line .There would be loss of communication to the region or local control centers and there may be some out of merit generation moves but it would not be a disaster . With the  redundancy of control centers, computers ,communications and data acquisition along with the proper protocols and procedures the loss should  not severely effect the security or reliability of the transmission grid .This redundancy will be an important part of the RTO development but there is no valid reason to slow up the present pace of progress because of this issue.","3","3","2","3","2","1","3","2","1","1"

A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's ""golden parachute"", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).

I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.

"107759","Canadian function currency","We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.

We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.

It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.

The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28.","3","2","1","2","3","2","2","2","1","2"

I checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per Lisa's comments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basically does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So Lisa's friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had no idea what these two entities did, kind of interesting.

A couple of weeks ago we bought an option on four more LM6000's for a Jan02 delivery.  The intent was to sell our 4 July01 machines and recognize approximately $5MM for this ""time swap"".  We believe that we are in a position to execute this swap (Delta Power is at the table), but during the past two weeks we have received very strong tolling bids (Merrill Lynch, Duke, Constellation) for the LV project that imply a $20MM value to the project but require a commercial operation date of Sep02.  COD of Sep02 requires early turbine delivery.  We are therefore leaning towards canceling the turbine sale/repurchase in order to go for the bigger prize.  It will require finalizing development, EPC contract, tolling agreement, finance plan and internal approvals by May 1.  I am recommending that we go for it.  If we are not able to pull it off, I am confident that the high bids for these machines will still be there.

Can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have, why there would have not been anything flashed.  If we should not have had an imbalance, then we'll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that PGEV shows an imbalance on their statements.

"1121025","India/Antibiotics","Gentlemen,

Ken asked me about storing antibiotics at Dabhol in case there is an anthrax scare at the site.  I told him amoxicilline, which they have in abundance, will work.

I checked with our doctor and she confirmed this is true, but it must be taken for 60 days.  More effective is doxecycline ( much less expensive than cipro).

In any event, our doctor is researching our options with International SOS and will work with us to set up a protocol for handling any suspected anthrax cases at Dabhol, or anywhere in India for that matter.  Once we have this down, we will look to expand it to all of our employees world-wide who require such assistance.

"1306478","Memo to RAC","I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

"1247026","Enron","Mr. Lay:

I am a former Enron employee.  I used to be proud of Enron.  I believed everything that you and EES management said.  I believe that the Vision and Values that you and other senior executives at Enron preached are not worth the paper they are printed on.  Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence.  I don't believe you respected the rights of so many Enron employees who sacrificed their family time so that the company would succeed.  I don't believe you have any integrity when it comes to fully disclosing Enron's future.  You obviously have not communicated the truth to employees, analysts or anyone else.  Maybe you should look inside yourself to see if you have the excellence now that you demanded from your employees.

I would like to see you take ownership of the incredible debacle that has fallen upon Enron.  So many of my friends and colleagues are out of work because of the gross mismanagement that you and others have shown.  I believe the least you could do is go on record and address these people at a time of year that is so special to so many.  Do the right thing and show some of the visions and values that you spoke so highly of not so long ago.  Show the men and women of Enron and Houston what you're all about.

"291516","LPG Cargo - Pricing Update","Mariella,

Below is the pricing for ProCaribe's LPG purchase. There are four price tranches. The two fixed price tranches of 2600MT and 1768 MT represent volumes sold and yet-to-be-sold during the time frame April 16th to May 31st. Note that ProCaribe's revenue stream for the portion of LPG sold during the second half of April (~1400 MT) was based on Mont Belvieu of $0.543/gallon. Month-to-date Mont Belvieu for May is $0.5145/gallon. ProCaribe's revenue for volumes sold in May (~2900 MT) will be based on the average Mont Belvieu price for the entire month.

Pricing of this cargo has worked out such that ProCaribe will make approximately 1-cent per gallon more margin than it would had they purchased LPG at a 7-cent per gallon premium to average Mont Belvieu for the month in which the sales occurred.","3","2","2","3","3","1","2","3","2","2"

The people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are specifically dedicated to certain business units.

We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & Russell (Servat and Mitchell).  As the IT guy, I'm sure you are accustomed to such profuse praise.

However, many of the people on my team (including me) are on the EES LAN.  Historically, EES has supported us with the equipment we need and they too have been doing a fine job in that regard.  Historically, therefore, we have not budgeted for IT .... a practice which will change starting next year.  In the meantime, when we sought to migrate the rest of my organization to the CORP LAN we were told that we would have to pay for all of our currentequipment or give it back to EES.

"1034016","P&L Impact of Volumetric True-Up","John -

FYI.  From what I vave seen thus far I think it will be difficult getting anything accurate or timely out of Evan Hughes' group.  This is the group that is responsible for billing and settlements - the weakest link in our reconciliation problems.  Unlike ENA Power, Retail has Deal Capture and Risk Analysis under Sally Beck and the Settlements process under EES (Evan Hughes).  All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade Stubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconciliation.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the ""Customer Touch"" they want to maintain.  I think this approach is delaying our getting control of and resolving the issues that are keeping us from monthly reconciliations and cash to actual liquidations.  I think EES needs to be given an ultimatum to 1) either provide us with a Settlements function that allows us to flash and reconcile or 2) get out of the way.  We can provide them with the bill and they can lick it.","2","2","2","2","1","2","2","2","2","1"

"755603","ICE","Hey:

1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state.

2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.

Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary.","1","1","1","1","3","2","3","2","2","3"
"3025","Selling BPA Surplus Energy","Here are some refinements to our protocol for selling BPA Surplus Energy.  I have consulted with Marcus Wood on this, and he agrees with my analysis on these points:

1.  We can sell BPA Surplus energy to public bodies and cooperatives (""munis"") outside of the Pacific Northwest.  Therefore, the rule that ""Surplus needs to touch a NW muni"" should be expanded/relaxed to be ""Surplus needs to touch a muni.""  Stated in another way, the only customers we cannot sell Surplus power to are IOUs and marketers.

2.  Purchases of BPA Surplus that we sell only within NW are not subject to 60-day recall.  Likewise for Surplus energy we use to replace non-hydro resources that we then export.  Therefore, the 60-day recall provision only applies to energy that is exported out of the region, or that replaces hydro resources that are exported outside of the region.

Now that we are getting into winter months  we are going to want to keep our pressure up higher for Benson,  There may have been times that we may have lost a opportunity to not run Pierze, but sometime it may look like a opportunity but all the pieces may not fit for everyone. Gas Control will continue to try shut Pierze down when they can and with the cooler temperatures Viking may run with higher pressure which would allow us to free flow more often.

It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issues and offsets to refunds on the same date- October 26 (previously refund testimony was considered first, and testimony related to possible offsets to refunds was considered on a subsequent date).  This is very positive since it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and that the offsets issue will be marginalized.

"776214","Finland's FOEX reports further erosion on NBSK price levels","paperloop.com

HELSINKI, Aug. 7, 2001 (Press release) - There was a further downward slide in the European contract business prices for northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp. Most of the quotes for NBSK were in the $450-475/tonne range and the benchmark index dropped 2 percent to $459.82/tonne.

Contract prices for bleached hardwood kraft (BHK) pulp including discounts have approached spot prices, which are beginning to inch upwards, especially in the Asian market. However, contract prices in Europe continued to move down, showing a 2 percent drop to Euro 449.08/tonne. The 0.7 percent strengthening of the euro against the dollar meant that the greater euro decline converted to $396.85/tonne, that is, the dollar index registered a 1.3 percent drop.

Downtime announcements continue to flow in. In market pulp, including chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP), almost 1 million tonnes of supply reduction has been published. Also, European and North American papermakers have taken substantial curtailments in printing/writing papers as well as packaging grades.","3","2","3","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"

"291982","""H√ñEGH GALLEON"" - DELAY AT ALGECIRAS, SPAIN.","Kjell-

Thank you for the prompt response on my request for a report on this incident.  Please be advised that this delay could pose a problem at the discharge port as there may be another ship waiting to get in on that date.  The ship scheduled before us (the ""Bachir Chihani"") has slipped to an ETA of June 9 as well, so if that ship arrives before the ""Hoegh Galleon"", we may face delays in getting to the berth.  This could impact our ability to heel out the cargo, which means the economic impact to this delay could be more than just the lost day on the ship.  My current calculation for incentive to heel out the cargo is nearly $140,000.  I have asked CMS about the possibility of bringing the ship in on June 8 after the normal time usually allowed to start inbound (approximately 14:00 to 15:00lt).  I will let you know as soon as I receive a response.  In the meantime, please provide an ETA to Lake Charles using what you consider to be the maximum speed possible for the remainder of the trip.

It is very disappointing that so much effort would be put into flying a pump from the US to Europe and then so little effort put into trucking the same pump to it's final destination within Europe.  It seems that the least costly part of the trip has ended up costing a day of utilization on the vessel and could have an additional $140,000 impact.","2","2","3","3","2","3","3","1","2","2"
"275487","Management Team Changes","Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.","3","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","1","2"
"58560","Bridgeline Cash and AR","To all:

Last night I spoke with Trevor Milhalik about the cash distribution which would normally occur at the end of the year.  The most viable and quickest way to get the cash we felt was to increase the revolver from $35 MM to $70 MM because, as stated below, there exists significant current capital needs to fill the Enron #1 storage cavern.  However, even still, this would only ensure a cash distribution at the end of December - the normal schedule for the partnership.

There may be one more possiblity.  We could reapproach the board about the prior structure of levering up Bridgeline in order to extract cash from the joint venture - it failed last year because Texaco did not want the cash.  It may different now that Chevron is involved, but I doubt it.  My guess is that senior management (i.e. Louise) would have to put pressure on the appropriate channels.  I would rather pay a ""premium"" to Chevron/Texaco for levering Bridgeline than entering in a series of park-and-lend arrangements because we could get more cash up front. In addition, any park-and-lend arrangements could have negative earnings impacts contingent upon the shape of the NYMEX.","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","2","2","2"

""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

"772915","Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas","The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.

To hedge their portfolio, NPW entered into a long position with Enron.  David Port of the Market Risk Managment group in RAC found a fairly matched book.  It is true that two offsetting positions will liquidate, over time, at no loss.

The difference here is that NPW overhead is so large that, absent an equity injection, they would default to their creditors prior to the expiry of these positions.   I would use this simple analogy, NPW has a physical short, an offsetting physical and financial long, and a significantly out of the money overhead which greatly outpaced any margin (almost nil for 2000) they have in their contracts.

"1266310","Transwestern Red Rock Expansion","Keith,

If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new compressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existing units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken out of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we should be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragraph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in service within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., continue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and placed into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operating compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension for the abandonment.","3","2","2","3","1","1","3","2","3","2"

"722895","Transwestern - Dispute with SoCal Gas","Greg,

Thanks for sending me copies of the pleadings in the enforcement action that we've filed against SoCal Gas at FERC. Just a quick question. Should we initiate a state court action against SoCal Gas now so as to minimize any claims that could potentially be cut off by the applicable statute of limitations? I notice that the controversy goes back to 1996. It may take a while for FERC to resolve this. Have we concluded that even if FERC rules in our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enforce our rights under the transporation agreement(s) with SoCalGas? Even if we file a state court action now, SoCal Gas would probably argue that the state court action should not proceed until FERC reaches its decision. I don't know how strong an argument this is, but even if SoCal Gas keeps us from moving forward with a state court proceeding, would merely filing a state court action stay the statute of limitations? I'm sure you've thought through these issues already. I'm just trying to get up to speed. Thanks.","2","2","2","2","2","2","1","3","2","2"

The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?

Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.

"1120251","Gas Logistics Location","Pam,

Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.

On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.

I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.

"742877","EPSA/EEI on Reliability","This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability.  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.

I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC ""consensus""), but I think EPSA staff may be ""too flexible"" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.

It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.  I will check with some other EPSA members.","1","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","2","2"

"947387","Petrochem Desk","I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

"4666","TTC/ATC with the attachment!!","This gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.

We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : ""Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements"".

The ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.","3","2","1","2","1","2","3","2","3","2"

Steti's paper mill produces 200,000 tonnes/yr of sack paper, machine-glazed (MG) wrapping paper and linerboard. A revamp of the plant's PM is also planned for next year.

Although the bill will not contain the price caps sought by Democrats and a handful of Republicans, Barton said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committee deliberations.  A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor's request; increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; firing up mothballed power plants; and directing federal facilities to reduce energy use by 10%.

We'd like to update you on the timing of the process as we currently see it.

This Wednesday, December 19th, we will ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve bid procedures for potential suitors to follow as they proceed to make offers for a joint venture.  If we are successful, we will ask the judge to set a bid deadline of January 7th, 2002.  At that point, we would review the bids with the Creditors' Committee and, after a process to determine the best offer, we will jointly ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve the winning bid.  Additionally, we will continue to try to close a deal prior to January 7th, which would then be subject to competitive bids form other counterparties.   The number of counterparties interested in a deal continues to grow.

Between now and the bid deadline, we will continue to work with all interested parties and assist them in their respective due diligence processes so that they can make the most informed bids.

The release would be made following a meeting with the governor, if he is not willing to pursue our settlement proposal.  The press release is necessary to explain our reasons for terminating and favorably position us in this controversy.  ABA is operating at a loss (including cash flow) and Azurix management believes that absent a settlement, termination and international arbitration is the only acceptable alternative.

As background, yesterday afternoon the board of ABA voted to terminate the concession contract, unless a settlement is promptly reached with the provincial governor.  The union representative on the board abstained, but information on anticipated termination was leaked to the press and there has been some Argentine coverage today.  DowJones and Bloomberg are aware of this coverage and we are attempting to defer their coverage.  Attached for your information are the Q&As we intend to use in responding to media inquiries.

Keith Miceli is in route to Argentina to assist John Garrison and local Azurix staff.  I will be coordinating here and handling U.S. and international media.  Please let me know if you need more information or have any comments on the release.

"3672","Change of Control Provisions","As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

"280879","Colonial Outstanding AR","Again, I apologize for the lengthy note but this should serve as good backup for resolution of the original recall problems with Colonial.

First, I am treating Dec-00 as if it is truly a buy / sell situation though I believe that the intention was to recall ENA sales.  The below schedule of buy deals have not been paid (i.e. Colonial never actually billed ENA).  Therefore, I can use the payment due on these payables to clear the existing A/R balance.  The remaining $531.09 is inconsequential.

Second, Colonial gave me erroneous information for Mar-01 recall items.  They originally listed various sale items that were EOL deals, thus indisputable.  We have finally come to agreement that all recalls for Mar-01 should have been booked under ENA sale deal #336733, days 8, 22, and 24-26, a total of 22,500 MMBtu recalled.  Upon research of this new information it has been determined that the entire 22,500 is booked as buy / sell, as expected.  However the purchase side shows that 18,000 MMBtu of these items actually had an ENA purchase price of $0.00000 and 4,500 MMBtu at $5.54000, which was never billed to ENA but was paid.

Therefore, it seems obvious to me that in light of no price or non-billing of these purchases, the real intent was a true recall of our sales with no affect to the purchase side at all.  Furthermore, both the sales and purchase sides of the 22,500 MMBtu for Mar-01 has been ""zeroed"" out, creating a total credit due to Colonial of $103,050.  Please let me know if there are any objections to this.  If so, I will need support from Cindy / Dick for the purchases booked for Mar-01 prod. and their ""0"" prices.  See the below schedule for Mar-01 items that have been zeroed out.","3","1","2","2","2","3","3","3","2","3"

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send ""termination packages"" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.

This a technical group so I was probably overlooked as being a marketer.  Naturally the discussion revolved around potential targets and how to protect them from terrorist attacks.  The part that was disturbing was their desire to severely limit information that is currently in the public domain.  I relayed that I understood the need to protect critical grid components but limiting all information was equally damaging economically.  Some comments made implied that ""you can't tell who has the information with marketers because they change jobs so much"" and ""you need to keep info from people with loose lips""  There was no direct comment linking marketers and loose lips, but the whole undertone was that information might not be as safe with marketers.

While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers.

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.

"1292947","Northern v. ONEOK/Bushton Measurement Issue/Chromatograph malfunction 9/19-10/11","After discussions with Daniel Ind. Rick Kile determined that the problem was caused by a bad version of Daniel configuration software.    Daniel informed Rick that version 1.43 is corrupt and should not be used.  The software has a bug which can toggle the USER/STANDARD setup values when edits are made to the unit.  On September 19th the calibration standard was changed which requires the new calibration components be entered into the chromatograph.  These edits were made using the version 1.43 of Daniel configuration software.  Due to the problems with the software, some of the components configuration changed from STD to USER.  This change effects the communications between the Fisher ROC and the chromatograph which prevented the ROC from receiving some of the gas quality information.  Based on our research and testing we feel that this problem did not effect the chromatographs internal calculations.

Since the only items effected by this was some of the components and not the BTU or specific gravity, this problem had very little effect on the volume calculations.  For example I changed the methane and Nitrogen values by 1 percent and the calculated volume only changed by 0.07%.  Since the BTU and specific gravity were recorded correctly we can thus use them as a reference to determine the amount of change within the effected components.","2","2","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

"744713","APS Filing","I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing.  They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.

It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.

That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.

SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds.","3","2","2","3","2","3","2","1","2","2"
"759443","Security Idea","Dear Ken,

With everything that has happened in the past few weeks, I think we all realize how dangerous this world truly can be.  As an employee, I appreciate the security measures that Enron has implemented over the years; however, I think the events of September 11th show that maybe we haven't gone far enough.  Although we could do little about a suicide attack from the air, there are many other types of attack we could prevent or minimize.  The Houston Police Officers, around the buildings and on regular patrol, provide good basic protection.  However, in the event of a city-wide attack, the Police  would be unavailable and we would have to take some type of action ourselves.  The Security firm contracted for the building lacks the training to respond to life and death situations.  I would recommend, and volunteer for, a security team comprised of Enron employees with prior military or police service.  There may come a time, God forbid, when we just have a few moments to act and the police may not be available.  If we can't defend ourselves in the first few minutes of an act, it could be too late.  I served in an anti-terrorist unit in the U.S. Army and have a few ideas that I think could help.  If this is in the realm of possibility, I would be happy to discuss this with whomever you designate.  I do feel safe here at work but planning for the worst, before it happens, seems very prudent in these times.  Thanks!

"1249068","Sun Devil - ambient temperature affect on pipeline capacity","Eric,

What we have done was use meteorological data from the internet but have found that to be incorrect for remote locations.  The internet in some places reads low compared to the actuals at the stations.  I try to go by what the locals have versus the internet.  I think the internet data is more of an average versus the spots throughout the day even though they call them daily highs.  Go example is Station #1 were the internet data is about 5 - 8 degrees low compared to actuals at the station.  Same is with San Juan were I have seen temperatures in the summer hit high temps as early as 9:00 a.m.  Other factors to consider is not only the ambient temps but what the compressor unit can stand (ie; shutdowns or limit switches).  If the nightly exhaust temperature does not cool down enough at Bloomfield, the unit can be limited in power as early as 8:00 a.m. when it reaches 1400 F.  It appears that thre is plenty of power left to run but the unit can't get there.  I have seen power levels peak at 4000 Hp when the unit is site rated at 4500 Hp.

As time goes on, I'll either help you understand more or confuse you.  Let me know which direction I'm headed from time to time.  You can't hurt my feelings.  I'm copying Kevin to keep him up to speed.  Planning is not an exact science but we use experience and whatever REAL data is available.

"1275753","MMBtu Enhancement","Chris:

Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from someone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I would appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model.

Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.

With today's closing prices,  the Family Partnership's available BA line is between $25k-$50, which is an  estimate because mutual funds don't post their NAVs until around 5pm (Central  time).

Parts of Pakistan - in the north are actually a hikers paradise. Very green, very pretty and not very commercial- not like the more dry rugged areas in Afghanistan. The country on the whole has a very low literacy rate and that is the root cause for a lot of problems that we are currently seeing. There are a lot of Europeans/mainly English who are settled in Pakistan for years and infect my mother/aunt and most of my family have studied in Catholic schools. That side of the story often goes untold.

Eventhough a lot of people oppose the U.S led attacks you would be surprised at how many people in Pakistan support the attacks on Afghanistan. Those who oppose ar ejust more militant and vocal but not the majority by any means.  Most are just afraid of their security. Also they feel that they are already so poor that they cannot afford to go to war. But i think if this goes well it would be really good for the country.

As for American foreign policy. I think its has a lot of short term focus and can improve but then again it is always easy to criticize somebody on the top. The good things achieved by Americans is often conviniently forgotten.

"1336362","reaction from the credit markets on the earnings call","As we have discussed at the Board level as well as in Management Commitee, the default swap market is extremely illiquid.  While it is true that ENE is one of the most liquid names in the market, the entire market would move based on an order of $40 to $50 MM.  We have heard that there have been standing sell orders in the market totalling approximately $150 MM which have yet to be absorbed, it could be that the prices moved significantly in order for those sellers to find a buyer.

While this market is an important datapoint in evaluating the credit markets view of our name, it is not the sole determinant.  It is important to note that secondary trading levels of our bonds (a far more liquid market and accurate indicator of our ability to raise incremental capital) have only widened 5 - 10 basis points over the course of the day.

While I would very much like to tighten the spreads in the default swap market, I think that we need to keep those price markers  in perspective.  Having said that, anything we can do to support the credit and tighten those prices ultimately helps in our ability to raise debt in all markets.","3","2","3","3","2","3","1","3","3","3"

Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.

"39463","Tenaska IV Agency Agreement","Ed,

ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , Enron has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the service.  Rick Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.  If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the Enron estate to handle this.  The problem with Enron continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Please give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.

ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective.","2","1","1","1","2","1","2","1","1","1"
"84018","Congestion Wheels.","Hey Guys.

The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels.

Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.

McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).  I am coordinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.  Kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to EIM.  They will okay the current EOL allocation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology.

Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.  When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the intent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday.

Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.  I suggested that on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subject to final sign-off) for EIM.  The footnote should also say final reviews with EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business units are still preliminary.  I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Whalley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions since our review with Whalley 10 days ago.  --Sally","3","3","2","3","2","2","1","2","2","1"

I look over the past 3 1/2 years with amazement over the things and people I was exposed to -   the political conventions, the group off-sites, the trip to India, the Inauguration (okay, I could have lived without the Inauguration).  But all of these things I would never have had a chance to experience without Enron and the encouragement of you.  I learned so much here that I will have to draw upon for the rest of my life.  And the friends I have made and colleagues I have known have all had a tremendous impact on me.  I have never worked in an environment that had such high-quality people.  I owe you a lot, and I hope you know that no matter how hard things may have gotten, or how difficult some decisions may have been for you, you have never let me down and I have always held you in the highest regard.

I have wrapped up about all that I can here and had my exit interview today.  I will be taking finals next week and then spend some much needed time with my family.  But I'm definitely here for you if you need anything, and I am hoping for the best for Enron and its people.

"1112093","Offer of Power to Ontario","The Premier's Office and the Ministry of Energy have received John Lavorato's letter setting out the offer of 500MW from New York .  Judy Hubert  (Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy) and her staff have been given the task of reviewing the proposal and concept.  Garrett Tripp and I spoke yesterday to Chris Cincar, an economist who works for Judy.  We reviewed the rationale for the proposal with Chris and made the following points: a) we see no supply adequacy problem even in the event Pickering A is delayed; b) the purpose of the proposal is to offer an insurance policy so that the gov't can firm up a market opening date of March 1 without any concern about Pickering; c) the prices in any transaction completed pursuant to the proposal or something similar would not set the pool prices in Ontario;and  d) we emphasized that this was power for delivery during onpeak hours only. Chris asked for some further data regarding historical NY prices for the March through June period in 2001 and prior years  and for a comparison of the onpeak prices with 7x24 prices. Chris is away next week and we will be speaking to him again after Labour Day. Chris indicated that he wants to talk about the proposal to the IMO and other potential power suppliers.  Thinking more about this, if in fact this is something Ontario pursues, Garrett and I think that the obvious  governmental agency to be the counterparty would be  OEFC, which will hold a wholesaler licence in Ontario.

Kevin asked me if Enron would consider posting more margin than required by NYMEX on our option positions. He said that ""given ENE is now flush with liquidity"" he thinks it would make Enron ""look good"" in front of the EDF Board.  He asked for twice the margin required by NYMEX but stated that he would be ""ecstatic"" with 1.5x (about $5 million.)  He specifically asked me not to elevate this request to your level but I feel you have a right to know what EDF is asking of ENE.  He also told me that if we did not post the additional margin then EDF would have to give us intraday calls every time the market moved against our positions.  Kevin also state that EDF is too small compared to a bank and that he would prefer if EDF odes only execution of ENE deals and we clear all ENE transactions through a bank.

I have been out of town so may be missing on part of the story but I think it's ridiculous that EDF wants us to do them a favour when they ditched us when Enron was in a  severe liquidity crisis.

"888459","FERC rulemaking on Generator Interconnection","Jim --

The quick answer to your question on the Barton bill is that, yes, it does appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections, at least in part.  There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, specifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the issue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility.  Will check on that angle.

In any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdiction of Barton's subcommittee.  Instead, the tax title would have to go through the Ways and Means Committee.  There were some energy tax provisions in the House-passed energy bill last August.  Chris and I will consult tomorrow to see if this issue was included in that bill.

Aside from the tax issue, Barton bill would require the type of interconnection rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local distribution and to transmission).  In each case, the cost of interconnection would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly situated.  I will go back to double check, but off the top of my head I recall that the Bingaman draft specifically ""socializes"" the costs of interconnection.","3","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","3","3"

When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.

If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Just a quick rundown of the problems we encountered with Liz in scheduling. As you know, we started her out scheduling El Paso. After about 7 weeks of training and having her do intraday nominations, we put her in the weekend rotation. The first weekend she worked, it became obvious that she still did not understand physical gas flow. Shannon spent the whole weekend on the phone talking her through any changes that needed to be made. She didn't seem to remember anything that she had been trained on daily for the previous 7 weeks. When I spoke to her on the following Monday, she indicated that she just became confused after someone tried to make a change in the nomination. We continued to work very closely with her to make her understand how physical gas flow works on El Paso. I started receiving some complaints from customers who were very much aware that she didn't understand what she was doing. After several more weeks, Shannon was becoming frustrated with the lack of progress, so I told Shannon to write down step by step every piece of the day to day nomination and renom process. That weekend went much more smoothly because Liz had every step and every scenario drawn out for her. I have since had her scheduling SoCal Ehrenberg while the new people are training and that seems to be working out OK. I think the biggest problem with Liz is an inability to think outside the box. but she is willing to work hard. I hope this helps.

"1280570","from the merger agreement","I know there's a lot of anxiety about severance, reflecting the possibility that the existing Enron severance plan might be changed. I noticed in the merger agreement that a ""floor"" was set on severance.  Have you heard anything about what Dynegy has for severance?

I know there are exceptions, but I was just curious, as lots of folks are very nervous.

From the merger agreement:

From and after the Effective Time, Enron employees, excluding those covered by collective bargaining agreements, will be provided severance benefits that are at least comparable in all respects to the severance benefits provided by Dynegy under its severance benefit plans and arrangements for similarly situated employees. For purposes of the foregoing obligation regarding severance, the term ""severance benefit plans and arrangements"" shall not include any individually negotiated agreements. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 7.16 shall obligate Dynegy to provide severance benefits if an employee is offered a comparable position, benefits and salary with a third-party purchaser of the business operation in which the employee works without regard to the form of the third-party purchase","3","2","2","3","2","3","2","3","2","3"
"42330","Union Gas Limited - Synthetic Storage","This morning I called Union to inquire about an imbalance statement for April 2002 primarily because the statement that I received for April 2002 was missing the park and loan balances for contract HUB210E14, HUB210E28 and HUB210E29, totaling roughtly 1,461,431 mmbuts due Union.  In turn, I was referred to their Legal Dept. and spoke with Larry Fedchun (519-436-4690).  He informed me that because ENA owedUnion way in excess of the value of this gas, they have decided to net this gas due them against everything that they owed ENA.  I asked how they valued this gas and he said they went through several pricing models and scenarios yielding anywhere from $13MM to $16MM and finally settled upon somewhere around $13MM as the value of the gas due them on a volume of 2,528,557 mmtus (per the Mar. 2002 statement that showed the outstanding volumes).  We are currently showing this gas in our system as gas owed to Union and we are carrying it at a $0.00 value because it was classified as synthetic storage.  Please let me know your thoughts on this and how we need to proceed.  If you need copies of any statements, please let me know.

Attached is a gas supply proposal I receive from Duke Energy for delivery to the mission interconnect on TETCO.  They also provided me a quote on Tenn, but it was way off base.  This deal in combination with swing from NET may be a good start for the month of May.  The deal provides swing flexibility and would allow us to get our feet wet and see how NET operates the Mission system when they are not providing all of the delivered gas.  Let me know what you think.  I have had discussions with Elpaso/PG&E, Elpaso Merchant, Coral, and Reliant.  At this point, the Duke/TETCO option is the best that I have seen.  I look forward to comparing notes and having further discussion next week.

"743400","","Oscar -- At this point, FERC does not have jurisdiction over coops and munis (most public power entities are non-jurisdictional) and cannot ""force"" them to join RTOs.  TVA does not have to join an RTO either.  However, FERC does have some carrots and sticks that it can use, for example, a public that does not join an RTO could be precluded from using the jurisdictional (actually, the rest) of the transmission system.  Therefore, many will probably join just as they have currently filed ""reciprocity"" tariffs at FERC in order to have the advantages of using the system.  EK Coop currently has a reciprocity tariff on file with FERC, so would probably have to withdraw it at some point if it decides not to join an RTO.

Also, requirements to make publics join RTOs are in the current legislative proposals before Congress.  I am not sure that any will actually pass; however, Enron is working on this too.

"1104318","Project Gallup","Jean/Cris,

As a follow-up to our meeting last week, I reviewed the Gallup closing documents and I spoke to Gerald Nemec today regarding whether Enron Corp. issued a financial guarantee to ECHO (funded by Natwest/Equity Investor, Patty Melcher) to compensate for the risk from closing to the start of operations.  Gerald Nemec and Mark Knippa both confirmed that Enron did not issue a financial guarantee, even though the project closed prior to the start of operations.  At the time of closing, construction was about 2/3 complete and the legal documents were in place stating a definitive start date.  The definitive start date ensured that funds would flow regardless of whether the facility was operational.  Essentially, TW was on the hook for the annual payment, etc. beginning on the start date outlined in the legal agreement.  The investors were comfortable with the project's progress at the time of closing and they basically were willing to take TW/Enron credit risk without a financial guarantee.

"1101425","EES Generation Resources in CA","Jeff:

EES controls 2 generation resources in CA:  Enron WInd and Badlands.  I have a bad feeling about how these 2 resources are being handled by EES.  Badlands calls regularly and tells real time their unit is going up and down and we do nothing to change any schedules.  We are probably passing this all through to EES through volume management, but I doubt EES is passing this through to the generator.  Enron WInd sure benefits from the fact that we are a net debtor to the ISO as 100% of their power is going into real time and the only reason they are getting anything is because of ENA's ISO financial position.  If this was not the case they would essentially have collected nothing since Dec. 2000.

As part of your effort to try clean up this situation add this to the list.  I would suggest you move these resources over to the services desk and have us manage these contracts on a go forward basis with respect to settlements scheduling etc..  Get me the contracts they have and I can tell you what they are worth.  Then EES can just assign the deals to us.  They should not be dealing with generators anyway.

Our comments dispute the accuracy of FERC's estimate of the time required per respondent to comply with the requirements - 208 hours for the initial report and 3 hours for subsequent reports.  As we explain, because we don't manage our business in the way the reporting requirements contemplate, compliance will require manual review and analysis and FERC's time estimates are vastly underestimated from our standpoint.

"1249002","Additional Cost Estimate - Sun Devil Project","Doug,

No, its not unclear.  You are misinterpreting the instructions I was passing along to ENSR.  As a basic premise of dealing with consultants, one has to understand that they will spend time doing whatever you ask them to do (i.e., prepare a budget for tasks from beginning to an FERC filing or prepare a budget for tasks to take us from beginning to post construction).  Either way, you have to pay for what you ask them to do.  Therefore, you keep the marching orders as simple as possible, taking the process in steps.  In this way you eliminate superfluous tasks that are not essential at the moment.   Sometimes these projects start out like ""gangbusters,"" but for commercial reasons or some other reason, they go away and you could be left paying for a task that basically has no added value.  I have found it best not to go that route.

In this instant case, I had broken down my instructions to ENSR so as to minimize their expenditures and even though from your perspective ""ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for Sun Devil since day one"", the consultant need only know and respond to the task at hand - which is the way I have handled it.  That is why I worded my note the way I did.  It is not a ""new"" request, but a continuation of one that he has already started.   By working it this way, you only pay for what you need and for what you get - not for an all encompassing budget that may never materialize.","3","3","3","3","3","2","3","3","1","3"

I wanted to forward you this email that I sent to Vince.  He had come back to Richard and I to resolve an issue with the dropping VaR associated with TW.  Vince was asking if this was related to the processes that we have automated. In speaking with Vernon, the date of the ERMS problem with the San Juan basis discussed below happened to coincide with the date or near proximity of the unwinding the Wholesale positions that TW had held. Consequently, there were substantial changes with the VaR increasing during this period.  When the rolling price data dropped off, it rolls for 30 days, the VaR decreased substantially.

Hewitt showed that that transaction had been canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off line since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my normal contributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now taken place--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check this site very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted on the system we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this make sense?

Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the system when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of stating that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that there was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place at the closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was Wed.-- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that but, if they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the same price, what happened to the float?

As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW's efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.

"742918","ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION","All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.

"1273084","Answer","For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.

Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","3","2","3"

We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.

She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.  I told her I sent it to him.  She said, ""I didn't think you knew his last name?""  To which I responded, ""I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.  I'd promised him at Kenneally's that  I'd send it when I got the chance.""

Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.  I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.  Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the ""let's just be friends talk"" last week ( which I think was the right move ).

"275902","Update from Calgary","There are a couple of items that I wanted to update you on with respect to our outsourcing arrangements and staffing.  First, the outsourcing arrangement with Petro-Canada has been extended for an additional five-year term.  The commercial guys are very happy about this and have given a lot of credit to Energy Operations and Accounting for the successful renewal of this agreement.

Secondly, we have an existing outsourcing agreement with Startech Energy for volumes totaling 8 - 10 MMcf/d.  These properties have been purchased by a company called ARC.  The existing MSA for Startech properties is being terminated and a new agreement covering all of ARC's production is in the final stages of negotiation.  Starting in May/June, the volumes under this new arrangement will be between 50 - 60 MMcf/d.  This increased volume and associated receipt points creates the need to add one person to the Logistics group.  This position was not budgeted for, however,  I have received approval from Rob Milnthorp to add this position.  Please let me know if you have any concerns about this net staff addition.

"1354250","Do Supplemental Energy Bids Matter?","Bill, Chris,

I think this is the market notice you two were refering to.  Yes, CAISO  will use the lower of SC-submitted bids or a unit's proxy cost for purposes of determining dispatch order and the MCP of supplemental energy and A/S. However, my understanding is that this adjustment only affects the auction for supplemental energy and A/S.  If you have costs above the current price cap and your costs are above your unit's proxy costs (and are willing to justify them), you should bid your higher-than-proxy costs. If you are accepted, you are supposed to be paid as bid.

Let me know if you want me to follow up with CAISO (or let me know if you have asked them about this).","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","2","1","2"
"1121664","NOrm Coleman","It is unlikely that he will have any credible opposition in a primary.  Late last spring, there was a very well liked Republican state house member (assistant majority leader Tim Pawlenty) who was set to announce his candidacy, and the day before his announcement, Vice President Cheney called him and asked him not to run. This created a great furor in the press and the party for a short time.  Pawlenty agreed not to run, citing his desire that the party remain united so that we have a better chance of beating Wellstone. Although folks in the party were a tad miffed that Cheney was trying to be kingmaker, they ultimately want to win more than they want to put up other candidates.

Tim Pawlenty has now announced that he will run for Governor. Jessie Ventura, true to form, has said that he won't make up his mind until next summer!  If Ventura runs again, he has a very good chance of being re elected (he still has approval ratings in the 65-70% range).

As I mentioned earlier,  I don't believe that Wellstone will ever look at our issues in a rational or market oriented manner.  I tend to think that his votes will be just the same regardless of whether we back another candidate or not.","1","2","2","1","2","1","2","2","3","2"
"1302759","some info","Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

"1312470","hello 11/20","Hi there.  Well, I got my accounting test back  and it wasn't that great.  I made a B.  I missed almost all my points  on one of the big problems.  I screwed up the formula and used the wrong  number as the denominator which made the whole problem wrong.  I was really  bummed and felt really stupid when she went over it.  My friend Missy sits  behind me and the exact same thing happened to her on the same problem so I  didn't feel so bad after that.  Our prof is going to substitute our lowest  test grade with our final exam grade which she said everyone always does  really well on so I still have an A in the class.  I was still ticked  though.  I know a B isn't bad but when it's because of one problem you  screwed up it's frustrating.  If I hadn't screwed up the problem I would  have had an A.  Other than that, today had been unexciting.  I'll be  home tomorrow night and can't wait!!!  I was thinking of coming over in the  morning on Thanksgiving Day and staying till noon.  Would that be ok?

"1291549","FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg","We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.","3","3","2","3","2","2","1","3","2","2"
"1102746","Format of Credit risk reduction transaction agr","Christian-- Liz asked me to forward a good template of the three way agreement for assignment/ termination of trades in a credit-driven context. Underlying these transactions, if EPMI will emerge with trades with the substituted counterparty, EPMI needs to have a modernized master trading agreement with such party -- and sometimes the prospect of completing this type of transaction is incentive for a counterparty to modernize its paper/do an EEI with us.  I found also that the assigned confirmations needed to be reviewed closely to make sure that what EPMI stepped into was equivalent to what was being terminated; the confirmations themselves were sometimes amended as part of the transaction to make them conform to what EPMI insists upon as to product definitions, etc.  Please feel free to come back to me with any questions you may have.  -David

"773041","STORAGE ALLOCATION","Lynn, I have resolved Tony Gee and Matt Martindale questions concerning this weekend storage allocation for the gas day June 23.

Matt was concern that Tenaska's Mid-17 contract 106171 was cut by our storage allocation the first time on Intraday 2.  In fact this contract received a small cut on the Non-Grid AM cycle.  Matt changed his nomination in the evening cycle to change some of his supply from Northern Border's Ventura to Mid-17 storage.  This nomination change will now be code as ""incremental"" on his storage contract 21229 for the remaining cycles.  Tenaska was able to avoid storage allocation cut on their IDD contract 21229 until Intraday 2 due to a ""PRR"" code for supply cut by Northern Border at Ventura.  Our storage allocation  only cut Tenaska Mid-17 path for gas delivered to their contract 21344 due to storage cuts downstream.  I have advised Matt  to be aware of these problems when changes nomination.

Tony Gee thought he was being ""bump"" or cut in the Intraday 2 cycle on his IT contract 5915 and FDD  contract 102835 on his supply from Northern Border's Ventura.  Prior to Intraday 2 we donot true-up storage allocation cuts until Intraday 2 with Northern Border.  Tony was only checking his nomination with Northern Border on his contract 5915 and seeing all his volume schedule to flow.  Tony failed to check his schedule volumes in Hot-Tap after the evening cycle to see his actual schedule volume was cut due to storage allocation.   Advised Tony to check his schedule volume in Hot-Tap after each cycle.

"743192","FERC - PNW refund case","In a surprise procedural development, FERC has announced that it will accept written comments by both parties and non-parties to the ALJ's recommendations issued last month.  These comments are due by 10/31.  This is somewhat unusual because the case has been fully litigated and briefed and we had expected the full Commission to vote on this matter next week.  Some people think FERC is simply buying itself more time because it is preoccupied with other matters (although I'm not sure why they wouldn't simply just sit on the case for a few more weeks if that was the case).  A few parties have been in touch with Sen. Cantwell's office - they do not believe her office has been lobbying FERC - although they also report that Cantwell's staff is working on a letter to FERC to express her general dissatisfaction with the ALJ decision.  Another big concern in Cantwell's office is minimizing the refund liability of PNW parties in the CA case.

In light of these developments, perhaps we should contact Cantwell's office to discuss the case and its implications for the PNW.  Also, it appears that Sen. Murray is not so upset about the ALJ decision and views the whole affair much differently than Cantwell - maybe we should touch base with her as well.  From what I understand, the City of Seattle (the main driver for the refund proponents) was prepared to pack it in - they may see this as a second chance, and we should make sure our view gets heard.","3","3","2","3","3","2","2","3","3","3"

"59847","Crown Energy","I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

The second addition at issue is subpart (e) under section 8 of the opinion.

"2780","Jeff McMahon Named CFO","Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.","3","3","3","3","2","2","2","2","3","2"

The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.

However, we do support intra-day capacity release.","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2","2"

The new contracted max rate of .1020 is .0420 higher than the original rate and will be split 50/50 with ENA.  This will net TW an incremental $14,700, in addition to regaining the original $42,000.

"77311","Williams invoices for Tenaska","Good news on the November payment.  However, we still need to execute the wire for $2,290,500 to prepay April supply costs inasmuch as the issue here relates more to our inability to get an L/C in place prior to the end of this month.  We're working on the L/C matter with JP Morgan, and will have it resolved in April.  In the meantime, we've agreed to make the prepayment prior to Williams accepting April nominations (due yesterday per Joe Parks).

Mike needs to follow through with Williams on the November payment based on our findings.  Any idea who James may have spoke with at Williams?  It would be helpful to Mike to have this information when he calls the credit analyst that brought the issue to his attention.  Also, in response to Margaret's comment below, I think James made the December payment to Williams directly as a result of the Lone Star problem and our own cash management issues.

"1260800","Elevator Maintenance","Randy,

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.

As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes without saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mortem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating deficiencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in maintenance and monitoring that may have contributed.

Thanks, Gary","3","1","3","3","3","2","3","2","3","3"

The way that I see this happening is that we will buy the power from Cogentrix at their bus and then sell to a Counter Party at the same bus. We will keep our share of the profit and pay Cogentrix their share.  If there is no profit then we will pay them whatever the sell goes for.  Example being:  If the Bogie is $35 and they want us to sell power and all we can get is $30, then we will pay Cogentrix $30.  There may be times where we have to procure transmission.  In this situation I see us passing through these costs to Cogentrix.  As far as the Bogie, they will tell us what the Bogie is on a day-ahead basis.","2","3","2","3","2","2","1","1","1","1"

WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association.  The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow.  In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs.  I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal.  In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership.  The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years.

Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage.  He seemed to be uncertain about his availability.  I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time.

"59481","out of interest","Calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for Pastoria was overpriced by $9.9MM, the amount of the Catalytica credit.

A brief confusing history as I understand it...ENA East and West jointly owned the Catalytica equity account in 1999.  It was written up based on expectations of an IPO value.  At 12/99 it transferred to West Power because Catalytica entered into an agreement with Pastoria to provide the Project with its Zonon technology.  This agreement included a commitment from GE to do research/work in order to use the Catalytica technology on GE turbines.  The cost of this ($9.9MM) was added to the Pastoria turbine contract.

In Feb 2000,  when I arrived in Portland, I had the Catalytica account transferred to the Portfolio because I thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ENA West Power.  In mid-2000 the agreement was restructured in order to ""clean up"" Catalytica so it could IPO.  At that time, Enron was credited back the $9.9MM from Catalytica and it was decided by Delainey that that amount should be split 2/3-Pastoria and 1/3Catalytica Equity, with the 2/3 going to ENA West Power upon the sale of Pastoria.  Pastoria did not get the full $9.9MM back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings.

At this time, since there is no funds transfer, I believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the Merchant Portfolio to ENA West Power.","3","2","2","3","2","2","2","2","3","2"

"893210","Program Changes","As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.

Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

Always remember, it is you that makes this group successful!!!  With over 600 of you employed by this company, you make a difference.  It shows in everything we do from one of the (if not the) most successful first year constituent golf tournament in HAO history/ to the inspiring of Texas A&M to form Aggies@Enron in our image/ to being the envy of other organized groups.  I am incredibly proud to be a Cougar, not just because of the university but the quality of our graduates.  Please keep the faith!  With your support we will achieve new heights!

"1034003","mae measures","That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tenso, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell ""excess power"" not consumed (capped at their ""cota"" or ""meta"" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to ""flood"" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers.

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product (""Restricted Power"")","1","2","1","1","2","2","1","1","1","1"

You are so sweet to think of me. I am sorry I did not repsond sooner but I have been very upset and angry with the executives at Enron.  I have been fortunate and not been hurt as bad financially as so many others.  Still we have lost a great deal of money.  Second to that, however, is the pride issue.  I still struggle with having to answer questions from people about the validity of Enron.  I quess I have been here to long to have a sense of humor about all that has happened - hopefully time will help.

One good thing that has come out of this is the assurance from existing upper management that we are the heart and soul of the company and they hope we stay around until the end of the year before we consider other options.  Maybe the old timers with experience will look a little better to them now.  Those with less years will probably take their bonus and run.  Take Care!

I just want to send you a note to say thank you for all you've done for Enron.  I've been with Enron for 15 years (straight out of college).   I may have been impacted financially with what is currently going on but I certainly don't blame you nor anyone for that matter.  It just is.

I know that you and Enron have always care for the employees and for the community.

"1098921","EOL Pricing Algorithm","Hi Bob,

some comments :

1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.

2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).","2","2","2","2","3","2","2","1","2","2"

"685138","Edison's Argument Regarding PX Credit","Jeff, I have looked at your fax.  This is a tough one, due to conflicting agendas.  If we are actually PAID the PX Credits (or the remaining cumulative unpaid credit balances) SCE may be correct, e.g. if an ESP's purchased wholesale energy at the PX Credit rate or lower,  than their total cost of energy supply is the same or less than that of a Bundled customer.  The impact on the TRA account should have been the same regardless of customer type, but only if they can prove the PX credit actually equals their purchase cost.  This may re-open the audit issue.  How does anyone really know that SCE did not enter into purchase contracts at other than PX - market rates?   If they did, they credits should be in this account as well.

As you know,  we have not been PAID these PX amounts.

I probably do not have enough history re the TRA accounting to give you a good defense against their argument, other than a  non-by passable charge should not apply if the credit is not PAID.

One other thought, shouldn't the amount of unrecovered TRA also be born by the utility (of course, it would help if they were not almost bankrupt).  The intent all along is the utilities were given a set period of time to recover this amount, and once the time elapsed, tough luck.  How does this play into this.

Estimated fees for 2000 were approximately $1mm which includes statutory audits for certain entities in addition to the overall US GAAP audit.

What is the policy/guideline under which we should proceed with AA?  Would Enron prefer to negotiate this in their overall discussion for the Enron audit and then allocate to Azurix an appropriate amount?

"1359749","Balli Group/Alaghband Update Report","I do not believe the Alaghband issue was researched for the first deal; however, the two deals are vastly different from each other.  The first deal (with Webco JV) was a 1 year inventory management deal in which we had title to the product the entire time.  That risk profile contrasts sharply with a 15 year option with a $40MM unsecured loan. Per our London team, the deal does not break even until year 7, and much of the value is in the tail. Clearly, a higher level of due diligence should be required.

Additionally, Paul Maley does not have pro-forma data on the merged Balli-Klockner entity - just a company prepared presentation. Balli is purely a trading company, and it is our understanding that Klockner is largely the same; the new entity is projected to be extremely leveraged.

"42040","MCV Invoice Update","I wanted to give you an update on where we stand regarding the invoicing issue on MCV.

I have spoken with MCV contact, Renee Schroll, and we are in agreement on the pricing of this contract.  Apparently, for a number of months they have not agreed with what Enron was invoicing them.  MCV would simply pay what they thought was due based upon the contract pricing.  Chris and I are working on getting some historical information on what was invoiced versus what was actually paid.  However, this has proven to be a laborious task and will take some time.  We need to reconcile how far back the error goes to determine if there is any AR/AP position.

Regardless, we do have the April Invoice worked out.  They shortpaid us the amount that was due to us based on April non-deliveries under the MCV II contract.  Chris has reviewed the replacement pricing, and believes it to be fair.  I have reviewed the contract, and the replacement pricing falls within the contract parameters.  The shortpay amount is $384,975.

Additionally, we still need to invoice them for $381,300 for volumes on Panhandle and for the 1 day's swing in April ($ amount to be determined).  We should be able to get this fixed at the start of next week.","3","3","3","3","2","2","3","3","2","3"

I just wanted to make you aware of EGM's intent to possibly separate their website from the fundamentals structure.  The impact of this would be that EGM content would no longer be available within the Commodity Fundamentals website.  I personally do not feel that this is the best decision for the business ENA&EGM, it would limit the current vehicle in which content is delivered.

"735296","cost cutting measures - from an Employee/shareholder point of view","Dear All,

The business units are operating on a lean G&A budget and cut costs whenever we can and making sure that we are efficient.  Are there any initiative to do likewise for all corp functions?  As an accountant in the business unit, we received corp allocations.  The total for corp was more than $700MM.  This, of course, excludes Enron Net Work, Enron Property, and Global Finance, which if we include those, the G&A to Enron could well be over $1Billion (not counting the business units G&A).

The number just blew me away.  I think we need to make sure all functions are needed and are run efficiently.  We cannot say it's OK just because we can allocate to the business units because the business units may not receive benefits for these costs.   We sure don't want Enron, as a whole, to be growing so fat and so fast that it will hurt our bottom line.  I'm sorry if I'm out of line, but I really do care about Enron and am very proud to be its employee.

However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.  It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that.

I definitely agree with your assessment.  We have a few other fish to chase right now before we give up the boat.

A few thoughts:  TIBCO is proposing a sales channel arrangement that essentially keeps Enron very much in the software business.  If we decide that we are comfortable having a foot in the software business for a period of time, we can always sign up sales channels, including TIBCO, whenever we are ready to do so.  Collaborating with a channel partner is a lot of work; in fact, initially it is actually more difficult than doing everything yourself.  So before we jump into the channels world, we would need to decide that we are ready to put the resources to the effort.  Regards.","2","2","3","3","2","1","2","2","2","1"

"1139220","Duke's Tie In Into the Pipeline Liquids Tank at Wt-1","Rich, concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact Transwestern if Duke should direct the liquids from their 8"" line into the pipeline liquids tank at Wt-1, I have a concern.

The liquids that are generated in the 8"" line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations (RCRA) as long as they stay in the Duke line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank.  Because WT-1 is a mainline compressor station, any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank.  Within the past few years, we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt-1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern.  Chemicals which producers and processing, upstream of Wt-1, have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal.  Unfortunately, there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials.

Based upon this, I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank.","3","2","3","3","1","1","2","2","3","1"
"1111677","Discussion with Rep.Ballinger's staffer re meeting with Pres. Chavez","Gents

I spoke to Ted Brennan, staffer for Cong. Ballenger, about the meeting the Congressman had with Pres Chavez.  Brennan stated that Ballenger raised a number of requests from his constituents over the course of the meeting which Chavez either acknowledged without really responding or said he would look into.  The Jose project I understand was not raised directly with the President though it was raised with the AmCham and other parties in the government that the Congressman spoke to.

Brennan commented that the President was preoccupied with the petroleum sector and views oil production as the key to helping the poor.  The President was not inclined, apparently, in this meeting,  to discuss diversification in investment so it was hard for the Congressman to engage him in a discussion about projects outside of the oil sector.  A refinery project was discussed as well as several other oil related projects.  But Brennan's view is that the President does not see as much value in investment outside of the petroleum sector as he does in additional investment in the sector.  Brennan also commented that there is real concern about possible nationalisation of projects in the oil sector.","3","3","2","3","3","2","3","1","3","3"

I have been pushing on her to get the information we need (although she reminded me it is no longer her job to do so), and she in turn asked Jay Bhatty to extract the data.  I have left a voice mail for Richard Miller, who is unavailable today, asking for a meeting or message outlining where the responsibility now resides that was formerly under Evan Hughes' operations group.  I also spoke with Diann, who told me she has a meeting set up with parties from the ""service desk"" in the new EWS organization handling data requests and CSC liason duties for us.  I asked her to impress upon them how expensive omissions can be.  She thinks an announcement of a reorganized group is coming as soon as Monday.

The CSC representative in Dublin producing the ""Frazier report"" mentioned below told me that PG&E has agreed to start submitting the expected switchover dates, but will back-date those fields for meters that are already flowing (ones that resulted in the shortfall between expected and actual load of returning customers).  That may be important in determining if there is any recourse for tagging the utility with some of the cost of underscheduling over the last two weeks.  I will keep you updated as I learn more.

"1278607","OPEC Pre-Game","Our sources in Riyadh continue to believe that the Saudis will push for a quota reduction of around 1.5 mb/d. The story out of Vienna early this week may be ""more than 1.5 mb/d including non-OPEC"" just to get a higher headline number. Also, the current view is that OPEC might make its cut effective Dec. 1, rather than Jan. 1 as OPEC President Khelil has suggested in recent weeks.

On one hand, the market knows that OPEC cannot fully implement a new quota as early as Dec. 1, but on the other hand, it would signal a more aggressive approach. This could buy the cartel some six weeks -- by the time Dec. compliance disappoints in early Jan., winter demand should provide some fundamental tightening.  And Nov compliance (with the current quota) should look good in early Dec.

Bottom line: talk of 1.5+ cut, plus possible early implementation date could take WTI higher early this week, although expect many players to sell rally. No demand-side surprises expected from Monday IEA report.

Finally -- the prevailing view right now is no smart sanctions and an easy Iraq rollover -- one more reason for OPEC to get aggressive. In the unlikely event that Bush and Putin agree on smart sanctions this week, the chances of an Iraqi disruption would increase and this would complicate OPEC's plans to move aggressively this week.","2","2","3","3","2","2","2","1","3","2"

"59864","","Re our meeting yesteday and discussion concerning Energy Capital Resources.  You are entirely correct that, from a management control standpoint, any investment whose performance falls well short of its approved projected financial profile should be considered for transfer into a ""special"" or ""management scrutiny"" portfolio.  The only issue, then, is whether the charter of Energy Capital is an exception to that general control principle.

Secondly, with respect to expedited DASH processing.  I met with Dave Gorte this morning to discuss some suggestions I had made, including going to an electronic approval system.  Apparently he and Rick Buy would be in favor but Jeff Skilling insists on a paper signature rather than electronic.  What RAC is going to do to begin, however, is a system of electronic DASH circulation including a signature page which could be printed out, signed, and then collected for the paper trail that Jeff requires.  I think this could significantly improve the process although it still does not address the issue of approvers who are unwilling to delegate responsibility when they are unavailable or approvers who insist on seeing other signatures before they will sign.

I have made reference to the fact that your continued  need to be a victim gets really old.  As I've stated many times just call  me anytime.  I'm usually home in the evenings after 5:00PM.  If you  ever try to call and miss me I will call you back.  I am more than willing  to discuss these items with again.  We have discussed them since your  request and I thought we were clear on them.  But we can surely discuss  them again.  I have given you Ravens school schedule and School name as you  requested a while back.  You said that you would call the school and get  the info yourself.  I thought it would be redundent to send it to you in  addition.  What Chris and I would prefer is that you discontinue putting  words into our mouths.  You do a fine job staying out of Ravens life by not  sending letters or calling.  About the Christmas gift, he did get it but  since he didn't get a birthday gift from you he thought that mabe that was it  and that you were going to send him a christmas gift later.  But if you  would have called him you would have known that he did get it.  The only  ""ripples"" are caused are your own doing.  Have I ever denied you visitation  or opportunities to come see Raven.  I know that you and I can honestly say  No.  As far as making love, how can someone that loves you make try to  convince you to have an abortion? ASSHOLE...","2","1","1","1","1","1","3","1","1","1"
"765254","Media Reports","As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible.

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

"44553","Final ERCOT Physical Hourly Firm LD Definition","Liz -- I've been unable to discuss this with Doug, as he's been out of the office. I'm not even sure if he's terribly interested in this product being promulgated -- the UBSWenergy ERCOT products he will first offer are confined to specific zones.  This product definition would presumably be used to support a ""Seller's  choice"" ERCOT-wide product spanning the four current zones, and the Market Clearing Price (""MCP"") applicable would be in that zone the Seller specified day-ahead. (That is, there are several moving parts to this.) The denomination 'Hourly Firm' was also a matter I wished to explore with him.  Attached is a markup with my thoughts on the draft product, and this morning I'm going to talk to some other folks who might have a read on the operation of the MCP in relation to the LDs calcualtion.  Please note that if one specifies that the MCP is the cap on the Replacement Price, then a presumption is being made that no additional costs are being incurred in purchasing substitute product.  I think this is an acceptable assumption but Doug may think different.   The corrections on the attachment include some intended merely to use the defined terms actually stated in the Protocols.  The changes in the second paragraph are intended to reverse any implication that the settlement on LDs would be held open a month or even 6 months until a final MCP value is identified by ERCOT -- I'd confine the window for recalculation to one month. --DP","2","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","1"
"1266351","Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance","I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule.

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.","2","1","3","2","2","3","2","2","1","2"

He has already contacted 4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a logistical nightmare.

He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

"57803","","Chuck's numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 bps in fees so we are slightly better than forecast. The 65 bps was comp for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from s&p and moodys. Had we not run into the el paso issues the number would have held. Given that the new structure requires a new market, new rating agency process and new documentation, we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction. An increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market. I still believe a sept 30 closing is unrealistic. If all goes well, I think we can be done by mid oct. To reach a sept 30 closing, I think the only option would be to ask bank of america to underwrite and buy the whole thing. That would likely be an expensive option. We can discuss in much more detail at our 9am mtg tomorrow. I'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to sep 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale 2 weeks later (ideally before 3q earnings release). The assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately el paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit. Just my thoughts. Ps: your gift made my day.

For the MichCon storage payment that is to be paid on 3/25, please change the note and delete that the payment request is still pending.  I gave my stuff to Doug on Thursday night and Rita was finishing up the wiring form last night.

For the $5313 payment for the Bear Creek storage et. al. that is shown to be paid on 3/25, we need to delay the payment until we can resolve the pricing and volume questions with the pipeline.  I recommend that it be delayed until say 3/29.  There is a chance that the payment will be lower than $5313 once we get everything resolved.  Is there a problem if the payment is reduced right before it goes out the door?

"888446","List of Assets in ERCOT","Jim-

As I mentioned in a voice message to you, your current list appears to capture our interests in power generation facilities located in Texas.  We questioned EWS Tax Planning, EWS Accounting, and EWS-Power Originations, to determine if anyone was aware of other Texas power generation projects.

There are LLC's/LLC structures set up for additional development, but none of them have financials.  The first is Newton Development/Lone Star Development.  It appears this structure was created to acquire land purchase options for Texas power plant development sites, and to develop an electric power facility in Newton County, Texas.  The second is Montague Development, LLC.  It appears that this entity was created to acquire land for and/or develop a coal fired generation facility in Brownsville.  I understand there are approximately 140k of costs accumulated on Enron North America Corp. for Montague, but apparently there are no agreements in place.

"754294","Best Wishes","Jeff - - -

Let me add to my best wishes for you and Rebecca that I conveyed the other night at Vallone's, my sincere hopes that the next post Enron-CEO phase of your life brings you personal happiness, fulfillment, fun and contentment. Although we often had different perspectives, my one-on-one sessions trying to get deals past you, while few in number, were some of the most stimulating and challenging I experienced here. I regret we never worked closely together - - you're the only really smart guy I've been unable to convince of/ demonstrate my value to in my working life.  I think Ken Rice owes me for pissing you off and getting deselected to head the new US electricity efforts in '93!

On a more somber note, I admired you for going over to Teeside last week to face the families. I can still remember vividly the faces, the destruction, the emotions in the hours after the San Juan Gas explosion in 1996. It was hard for awhile to get motivated to press ahead with the power/LNG project in the face of that tragedy and the distant thought that, gee, I'll be responsible for bringing the new facility to this island. Am I sure it won't kill people? If there was a catalyst or ""straw"" that tipped you across the line in asking how hard you're willing to fight just to keep doing the CEO job, instead of every other direction you could take your life, it wouldn't surprise me if the experience at Teeside was it. One changes, even if only subtly, after that kind of experience.

Thanks for treating me civilly even when you were the most angry with the rest of EI. Good luck with your new marriage and the next phase of your life.","3","1","1","1","2","2","3","1","1","1"

Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.

"743577","Weird procedural situation","OK, here are the facts as I understand them:  The CPUC filed petitions for review of the FERC's various refund orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There is an unresolved jurisdictional issue that the petitions filed in the Ninth Circuit are incurably premature because they sought review of orders for which the petitioner was also requesting rehearing.  The current status of the CPUC's Ninth Circuit petitions is that the court has not yet dismissed the petitions as premature and FERC must file the record in the Ninth tomorrow, October 26.  At that point, under Section 313 of the Federal Power Act, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals becomes exclusive, and  FERC will not be able to modify the orders under review except by leave of the court.  FERC has filed, and the CPUC is supporting, a motion for an order permitting FERC to keep jurisdiction over its orders so that it can act on the pending rehearing requests.  By all rights, the court should go along with this, but it's gone on this long.  We are not adversely impacted.  Arguably if FERC loses jurisdiction, the PNW and CA refund cases should come to a complete stop, although this is an unlikely scenario.  I will keep you posted of new developments.

The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.

I would hate for our senior management to think that this will play out in a nice orderly legal proceeding where everything is dealt with in terms of facts and reason and law.

Over the past few months, Rositza has been researching where the rebates related to Operations have been booked because Phil had earmarked them specifically to assist us in achieving our stretch target.  The rebates are not hitting Operations cost centers, and for numerous reasons from Accounting, they cannot be reclassified into the Operations hierarchies.  Since the rebates received are outside of Operations and Phil should get credit for them, I am reducing our stretch for the upcoming forecast for the rebates actually recorded through September and those expected for Q4.  This is a total of $1.0MM.  If you need documentation, I can forward Rositza's research to you.  Let me know if you have questions.

The ""ETS"" forecast we will submit for Operations will only include what will show up in that column for actuals at year end.  It includes our IBIT estimate for co.'s 1202, 184, 42P, 1195.  Any other amounts we have carried there in previous forecasts will be moved to the pipeline where we expect to see the actuals.

"1124565","Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles","Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk","3","2","2","3","2","2","3","3","1","2"

Thanks for the reply.  Your thoughts on the EEI draft in terms of details would be helpful.  As I read it, we still have the problems with the EEI draft that we had with the NERC draft on which it is based -- deference, regional rules variances, regional reliability entities, regional advisory boards, limits on FERC authority, etc., etc.  It would also be helpful to have input on whether the plans for EISB could go forward if legislation like the EEI bill were enacted into law.

"1308548","Niagara Mohawk Opportunity","As you may know, last week NiMo announced that, in response to PSC resistance, they were terminating their agreement with Tractabel, which had won an RFP to supply power to NiMo to meet it's customers full requirements over the next five years. Part of that deal would have transferred all of NiMo's PPAs and transitional contracts with their divested generation owners to Tractabel as well. Enron had responded to the RFP but our proposal was not particularly aggressive since we thought the RFP as defined by NiMo  made little sense.

Seeing an opportunity here, I just spoke with NiMo's Chairman and CEO, Bill Davis (whom I had previously worked with for many years while at the State Energy Office) about Enron's interest in assisting NiMo in managing its power and gas portfolio, now that the Tractabel deal is dead. I suggested setting up a meeting at which our Gas (Frank) and Power (John) folks would be present, and offered that we could agree to a confidentiality Agreement if he thought one was needed. Bill did not reject the idea of a meeting and said that he would talk to his people and get back to me. I'll follow up with Bill in the event I haven't heard back from him by the end of next week.

(age does that to you sometimes).  Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.  I never thought I d see the Enron empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the Enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of Enron.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.  Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on Jesus and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.

Sorry to hear that there is the word ""reorganization""  in Hess.  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.  I hate this kind of stuff. I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.  Ill keep you in prayer. Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?  Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.

"1304538","Schedule 1 Fee Changes","At Friday's NYISO Management Committee meeting, two proposals were approved that will affect next year's rate schedule 1 charges. The first involves the assessment of regulatory fees charged by FERC for its electric industry costs. As you are aware, effective next year, FERC will be changing the way its electric program costs are assessed to market participants. Under the new method, a unit charge will be assessed against public utilities providing transmission service, including ISOs. NYISO estimates an annual assessment of $4-6 million. These fees will start to be recovered through the rate Schedule 1 charge effective January 1, 2002. This should equate to roughly $0.03 per MWH. The second item approved at Friday's meeting concerned the proposed 2002 budget for the NYISO. Total costs will be increasing roughly $12 million, which will raise the schedule 1 charges for running the ISO (currently $0.60 per MWH) by $0.03 to $0.05 per MWH, depending on the size of the proposed contingency fund that may be included by the Board. Offsetting these increases is the elimination of a $0.30 per MWH charge that has been collected during most of 2001 to create a $50 miilion working capital fund. The ISO expects to achieve full funding of this fund by the end of the current year.","2","3","1","2","2","2","1","2","3","2"

I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.

Now it's time to look forward.

With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

"56287","Tax reserve on Allegheny Peakers","I just spoke with Matthew and he explained that the transaction tax reserve calculation (a summary of which is attached) was prepared (and communicated to the deal group) early last fall.  The calculation indicates that the aggregate transaction tax exposure (including penalties) is $12,940,182.  The initial suggested tax reserve related to this exposure was approximately 1/2 of this amount but, after discussions with Don last week, was increased to 100 percent - thus the increase in tax reserve of approximately $6,000,000.  Thus, as evident, it is not that a calculation was incorrect but that its assessment probability was increased and thus the suggested tax reserve changed.  Matthew was influenced in increasing the applicable level of risk related to the transaction by a desire to more conservatively posture Enron after the completion of the disposition and to insure that subsequent period ""surprises"" did not occur - obviously, to the extent that collective management is of the belief that such a conservative posture is not appropriate then the tax reserve amount may be reduced.  Matthew spoke with Don before the change was proposed and was under the impression that all were comfortable with the change before it was made - ultimately, we will realize the reserved amount in earnings as the risk of the tax planning strategies subsides.  Matthew will be back in the office on May 8 and ready to speak with whomever desires at that time.  I am attending the Enron Law Conference beginning this afternoon, followed by the Enron Industrial Markets Offsite next Monday and Tuesday but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-817-5052.

"1285215","Impact Shares","John, Milly has asked me to move the share certificates for Impact Energy to Enron Canada's control.  These shares currently reside in a Morgan Stanley account controlled by ENA.  As you may recall Enron Canada bought and paid for these shares and special warrants.  Enron Canada directly owns 1,595,455 shares valued at USD$1.6 million and indirectly owns 1,300,000 shares (through JEDI) which Enron Canada beneficially owns 50% worth USD$650,000. These securities are worth USD$2.25 million to Enron Canada and I believe represent the only significant non trading asset in Enron Canada.  Enron Canada proposes to move all the certificates to the control of the legal group of Enron Canada.  The logic is simple, Enron Canada has a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and creditors to control its assets and if they need to be disposed we are in the best position to realize full value for the securities.

EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates.  The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists.

I have a call in to EPSA to see if I can get any more details about what the press release will say.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for the press release.   I'll let everyone know what comes out of the FERC meeting as soon as I find out.

"292648","EnronOnline and NYMEX","Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday.

The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.","3","3","1","3","2","1","2","2","2","1"
"59837","Hanover","GKH's drag-alone rights only extend to stock actually owned by JEDI (or a subsequent purchaser in a ""non exempt"" transaction).  To the extent we have disposed of a part of our interest in a public sale (an exempt transaction) the rights do not attach to the shares themselves.

If JEDI sells to a third party in a non-public transaction (a ""non exempt"" transaction) this stock would be subject to the drag along, tag along conditions and the other provisions of the Stockholders Agreement.  There are other restrictions that restrict partial sales in a non exempt transaction to less that 50% of the original share ownership.

Enron has valued the Hanover investment at the screen price for mark to market accounting based upon the free disposition in a public transaction.  There is no question that any restriction on private sales theoretically impacts value negatively.  On the other hand, the ""tag along"" rights theoretically have a positive impact on value.

In your example, if GKH sells to XYZ subsequent to completion of Enron's sale to ABC, in that case GKH could require ABC to sell to XYZ at $20.  On the other hand if GKH cuts a deal to sell to XYZ at $60, ABC would have tag along rights of inclusion at $60.","1","2","2","1","2","3","2","2","2","2"

"1336734","","Ken,  I just wanted to say thanks for all that you and Enron have done for me.  I know you trusted people close to you and they let you down for that Im sorry.  I have always believed in you and what you stand for.  I  know it took tremendous courage to do what you have done over the last couple of weeks.  Whether the people at Enron like it or not I believe you put us first.  I trust that your decision was the right thing given the circumstances. Yes, Im deeply hurt by the last month but the true spirit of Enron will last within me forever.   I started at this company a mid level IT Administrator and I am now a seasoned Director level technologist and leader.  I have had 4 promotions in the last 5 1/2 years.  I have been challenged by this environment.  I believe that I can go anywhere and be successful because of meeting those challenges.  No where else could have provided me these opportunities. In return Im going to stay committed and have faith that due to that committment the Enron spirit will live on.  With all the bad I wanted to remind you of the good. My years of employment with Enron have been the best of my career.  No matter what happens I know I will be fine. I truly wish you and your family the best.

The goal of the Links meeting is to improve communications and coordinate outage so that we can have the least amount of throughput loss for all. We also discuss any ideas that can be improved on. One idea that Mobile brought up is they would like to call into gas control in the morning around 6:30 to 7:00  and get an update of any outages during the night in the Hugoton area that may have caused them to be short on gas. They need this information so they can report in their marketing meeting so they can adjust noms. So if the central controller could start making notes of any outages in Hugoton during the night that affected flow and pass them on to the day crew they would have this information to pass on and not have to look it up. This would be very helpful for Mobile. They may not call every morning but we need to have the information when they do.

Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been having headaches, so I was concerned.

She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

"1120276","SoCalGas Complaint","A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint

1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.

2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).

3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.","3","1","2","2","2","2","2","2","3","2"

"37074","16b Status","Rick:  There is no legal requirement that the Board determine, approve or ratify the Section 16 list of officers (although in practice, we have asked them to do so in the past, at least on an annual basis).  Whether someone is an executive officer is a question of fact, and I have not gotten any responses from others that I have attempted to get information from to determine whether or not we should update the list (the lack of response, I'm sure, is due to the fact that there is a lot of stuff going on).  So, I will give you a call to discuss: (i) has your title changed? (ii) have your responsibilities changed? (i.e., are you still the Chief Risk Officer?)  In the environment of a Chapter 11 proceeding, is there any need for a chief risk officer?  (iii) are you still on the Executive Committee (is there still an Exec. Committee, does it still meet and what are its duties and responsibilities?).  No one factor is determinative---the issues are:  do you oversee or set policy for an important business or administrative function of the Company?  In our former environment, the answer was easy.

"756530","TCPL Fair Return Application","TCPL filed an application with the NEB yesterday seeking an increase in rate of return.  They are asking for a new methodology called ""After-Tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital"" which would be 7.5%.  Using the existing methodology this would translate to a return of 12.52% on 40% deemed equity in the capital structure (equity thickness).  This would equate to a return of 16.69% if the equity thickness was 30%.  Currently TCPL has a regulated return of 9.61% and 30%.

If TCPL gets what they are seeking it would result in an annualized Eastern Zone toll of CDN$1.25 (Chippawa $1.261).   The invoiced toll would be higher to recover the difference from the interim toll, currently set at $1.132.

"1268352","Darrell Kinder Repatriation","Phil / Danny,

As you may or may not know, I am in the process of selling Enron's interest in our joint venture in Korea. We have a formal bid procedure underway, assisted by Goldman Sachs. Preliminary bids were received last Thursday , and final bids are due on January 7th.

I was reviewing the results of the preliminary bid submissions with Stan and Jim Hughes on Friday , when Stan suggested I contact you. With final bids due on January 7th, my target is to close and fund the sale by the end of January. When the sale closes, Enron will be out of Korea and no longer need my services here. As a bit of background, about one year ago , I needed to get my daughter back into the United States for medical and educational reasons ,so I repatriated my family to Orlando , Florida. At that time ,I (or anyone else) could have forecast the events that have taken place within Enron.

Stan thought there might be something for me to do in Maitland , and I told him I would be interested in that or Houston for that matter.

"56430","ENA Allocation of Budget","Louise --

While I have already reduced the allocation to EA by 15% or over $400,000, I have talked with Accounting regarding your concerns and have suggested a few changes to the allocations.  The new suggested allocations are EA 30%, EGM 20%, EIM 20%, ENW 20%, EBS 10% and EEOS 5%.  This is based on services provided and headcount within the various business units.  The services include media relations, events, marketing & advertising, and internal communications.

There is no increase in headcount.  We are at 10 positions, which is the exact same number we have had since February 2001.  In fact, I reduced the size of the group by 2 positions when I was promoted to lead the department in May 1999.  The two reductions are one less person in Marketing and Advertising, and one less person in Events.  While the number of employees has fluctuated at times this year with departures from the group and prior to hiring a replacement, I currently have no openings and the group has 10 total employees.

"1303432","Eucalyptus Pulp - Final Note","Martin,

Subsequent to my last e-mail I discovered an additional detail which may possibly clarify why ENCE prefers to purchase the Chilean E. globulus species to the Brazilian species for pulp production.  It would appear that the E. globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during the refining process.  While most papermakers generally don't refine hardwoods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingly do use a single refiner for all grades.  This is particularly true of the Italian mills.  Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining required for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opacity, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suited for this type of processing.  Accordingly, the globulus species (which is also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much better under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus.

In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.  Thanks.

The remaining dollars are the last of the allocation for the share of the PGAS projects committed to by HPL and paid for by ETS.  HPL/AEP has been running in a PGAS stand alone production mode since October.  I do not want to do an invoice but would like to do an intercompany charge.  There already was a work order set up to accept the PGAS charges  - C.007054.  It seems to me that it would easier to have all the charges in one place to get reimbursement from AEP than to have them spread out all over.  The sale of HPL did not negate the obligation HPL/ENA had to ETS for the cost of this project.  Even when the sale was being contemplated in Dec 2000, Jan 2001 timeframe ENA told ETS to continue on with the project for HPL.

Unfortunately, we can't guarantee payment to these counterparties.

Counterparties have to do the math and see whether they are better off delivering to us---and not getting paid---or terminating, and paying us for the in-the-money value of the contract.

The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.

I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.

"1134056","ENS Audit 2001","I understand that due to Enron's problems in America and the fact that that Arthur Andersen are getting involved in a dispute over various audit matters as a result of the bankruptcy there may be difficulties in having Andersen audit ENS for year 2001. While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.

Andersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.

New auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch. This would consume time not only from the accounting department but throughout the Company. The audit would take longer and, at this stage, I'm not sure when any new auditors would be able to start given that January is their busiest period. Andersen are available with immediate effect since I have constantly been impressing on them that, given the complexity of ENS problems, we should allow ourselves the maximum amount of time to consider what to put into the report should some problems persist longer than envisaged.

I feel that a change in auditors at this moment in time would be not be in our best interests in view of the above. Also if the ownership of ENS is to be changed it would be beneficial to have audited accounts in double quick time since potential investors will undoubtedly be looking for such statements.","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","2","1","3"

"685331","Negative CTC Issues","On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the ""high"" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to ""re-bill"" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all ""high"" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.","3","3","1","3","2","2","2","3","2","2"

-	Power strike set for March 16 in Mexico City

Some 35,000 members of the Mexican Union of Electrical Workers plan to strike the Mexico City Electric Company on Friday, March 16th at 12 Noon. The union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing. The two sides are not even talking. The union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements. The union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors. The company principally provides electrical service to Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Morelos, Hidalgo and Puebla. It may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions. (Pinkerton, March 14, 2001)","3","3","2","3","3","3","2","2","3","3"
"3968","INC SHEET AND INC SHEET POSITION MANAGER AND P&L SHEET","Ryan,

I made two styles of inc sheets for our future use.  One of them is an inc sheet, position manager, and profit/loss sheet in one...please note that the colors are a little busy and it may be simplified.  The other is broken out with the inc sheet similar to yours with a few additions and then the position manager and profit/loss sheet on a different worksheet.  See what you can do to improve them...Obviously neither are fully integrated yet as I am a bit rusty on my excel skills.  Especially when it comes to macros.

If you want I can come in later today and we can work on them together.

If I happen to be away from the phone taking care of my mother, leave a message and I will return your call immediately.  There is a generic message on my home phone, ""Please leave message after tone"", so don't worry that you have the wrong number.  You may reach me by email at adupont@pdq.net.  In the next several days, I will be set up to dial in and you will be able to use my regualr Enron email address.  I will be at my desk most days, but until we have mother settled in the Rehab facility there may be some days or afternoons that I will be working at home.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need meetings set up or any other thing that you would normally request of me.  Thanks.  Anita","3","2","2","3","3","2","3","2","1","2"
"775306","Mexico Employees' Vacation, Other Benefits","Meliza Evanson called Friday asking about vacation and other benefits for Mexico employees.  Meliza said she has been using the standard 3-week vacation benefit for the Mexico offer letters, etc.  The Mexico Agreement we sent her (for her information) suggests a different vacation schedule.

Meliza indicated there is a lot of confusion regarding the benefits for the Mexico employees.  Meliza has put together a 2-page benefit guide for the Mexico employees based on information she has gathered.  We need to get clarification of the benefits and to approve her handout.

Who has final say about the benefits?  Can you direct me?

Thanks.","3","3","3","3","1","2","2","2","2","1"
