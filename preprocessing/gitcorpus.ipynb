       "'Donald Malloy (born November 28, 1955), is an American gospel musician. He first came to prominence singing with the New Jersey Mass Choir and is a featured singer on the group\\'s own 1985 version of the song they had originally recorded with Foreigner, \"I Want to Know What Love Is.\"  The following year, Malloy began his solo career, releasing the album, Holy Spirit.  However, his solo career truly took off four years later in 1990, with the release of, There Is No Limit, that was released by Atlanta International Records. His subsequent album, No Greater Love, was released in 1995 by Glorious Music, but it failed to chart. All but two of these albums chart upon the Billboard magazine charts, exclusively on the Gospel Albums chart.'"
